<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>


<p>Jack's cowboy life began just as a great change was
sweeping over the cattle range. Cattle had first been
brought into the country only a few years before&mdash;old-fashioned
long-horns driven up over the trail from
Texas.</p>

<p>In those days the people in the West were not many.
Towns were small, farms almost unknown, wagon
roads few. Except about the pastures of the larger
ranches, there were no fences. Over most of the
land the cowboy roamed alone.</p>

<p>His seemed a life of romance. Free as the birds,
he wandered over the wide range, going when and
where he pleased. But this romance was only apparent.
No man worked harder than he, or for less
reward. His toilful days and short broken nights;
his small pay and his poor food were recorded in the
songs that he sang as he rode about the cattle. This
was in the early days of the cattle industry.</p>

<p>A little later, on the plains came a change from
pioneer conditions to those approaching luxury.</p>

<p>The earlier cattlemen in the North&mdash;those who
ranged their stock on the Platte and the various forks
of the Loup River&mdash;made great profits. Yet as time
went on they saw competition constantly growing
sharper and ranges being overstocked. As the news
of their profits drifted eastward many young men, allured
by the romance of the cowboy's life, and ignorant
of its actual conditions, came into the cattle country.
These believed that success with cattle was to be
attained by riding about and watching the cattle increase
and grow, and shipping them to market when
they had grown. They were glad to be interested in a
business at once so agreeable and so profitable; and
many a one exchanged his money for a herd, a brand
and some log buildings, and rode over the range awaiting
the advent of his riches. Many of the early cattlemen
sold their herds to the newcomers, who, somewhat
later, discovered that with the cattle they had bought
also much experience.</p>

<p>These changes were in operation when Jack entered
on his cowboy life.</p>

<small><small>THE TRAGEDY AT POWELL'S</small></small></h2>


<p>"Well, Jack," said Mr. Sturgis, "I do not know
where you'll find them, but possibly somewhere over on
the Little Medicine. If I were you, I'd ride over to
Powell's. They are sure to know where the outfit is,
and if you can't reach camp to-night, you can stop at
Powell's."</p>

<p>"All right, Uncle Will; I'll go over there and probably
get to camp to-night."</p>

<p>Jack shook hands with his uncle, and stepping back
to his horse threw the reins over Pawnee's head, and
swung into the saddle. With a final wave of his hand,
he trotted off toward where his string of horses were
feeding on the meadow before the house, and riding
to and fro behind the scattered bunch, gathered them
together and started on down the road.</p>

<p>Mr. Sturgis stood in front of the corral filling his
pipe, and watching his nephew grow smaller and
smaller, as he moved along down the road close to the
pasture fence. It seemed to him a long time since
he had first brought Jack out from far New York
to the Swift Water Ranch, a little slip of a lad, thin
and pale. He remembered their first drive from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>railroad: how he had killed a bear crossing the road,
and how Jack had seen what he supposed to be an
Indian dog, which, of course, was a coyote.</p>

<p>"My!" said Mr. Sturgis to himself, "certainly the
years slip by! Then I could have lifted that little fellow
and held him out with one hand; and now he is
big enough to lift me!"</p>

<p>Jack had risen that morning soon after daylight,
and had gone out to get his horses together. The
night before, Joe had brought in and put in the small
pasture the few saddle horses left at the ranch. That
morning they had been driven into the corral, and Jack,
aided by Joe's knowledge of the animals, had selected
six for his string to ride on the round-up, taking along
his old favorite Pawnee for a regular riding horse,
but not for a cow horse. Good saddle animal as
Pawnee was, Jack thought too much of him to be
willing to use him in the long rough work of riding
circle or branding calves, or throwing big cows, if
any old mavericks should be found. For the most
part Pawnee should travel in the <i>cávaya</i>,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> though
sometimes he might be used on night herd. Jack made
up his mind that hard work Pawnee should not do.
"Give him just enough exercise to make him enjoy
his victuals," Joe had said that morning when they
were talking the string over.</p>

<p>The horses had been brought into the corral, and
one after another of those chosen had been cut out
and sent out through the big gate, all except the one
that was to carry Jack's bed. That one had been
roped and taken out and tied up to the fence. Then
Jack had gone up to the house and brought down his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>blankets and a few extra clothes, and having wrapped
them up in his "tarp," the bundle had been put on
the horse with the regular cowboy hitch, and the animal
had been set free to feed with its fellows. Then
had come breakfast, and he was ready.</p>

<p>It was nearly a year since Jack had crossed a horse,
and it seemed very pleasant to be trotting along over
the prairie, the bunch going nicely ahead of him.
They were fat and frisky and every now and then
one of them would lay back his ears and nip at his
neighbor, and perhaps the sudden motion would start
the little bunch into a gallop, from which they would
almost at once come down again to the steady trot.</p>

<p>There had been rain enough&mdash;so they said at the
ranch&mdash;during April, May and the first few days of
June, but now the prairie was dry and a little cloud of
dust rose from under the horses' hoofs. The bottoms
and the high hills were brightly green. Moreover,
they were dotted with many beautiful flowers&mdash;which
of course Jack could not see, because he was
moving along swiftly&mdash;and down on one of the wet
meadows the purple iris, already in bloom, had colored
the ground blue in spots.</p>

<p>It was a couple of years now since Jack had been
to the ranch, and a good many things had happened;
for when a boy is from seventeen to nineteen years
of age, things are likely to happen to him pretty fast.
He receives many new impressions, has new experiences,
and certainly picks up knowledge of one sort
or another at a rapid rate. Since Jack had last seen
these prairies and mountains he had passed his examinations,
entered college, and spent nearly two
years there. He had certainly had a good time while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>he was in New Haven. The toughness and endurance
that he had picked up during his summers on
the plains and in the mountains had stood him in good
stead in athletics and he had won a place on one of
the football teams. During a part of his sophomore
year, he had had the bad fortune to have a long and
tiresome illness from which he was only now convalescing,
and since he had lost much time, it had been
thought best for him to go out to his uncle's ranch
before the end of the college year and to spend the
vacation there in getting well.</p>

<p>When he reached the Swift Water Ranch two days
before, the round-up had already started and now was
in full swing; and Mr. Sturgis, after satisfying himself
that Jack was strong enough to do the work, had
told him that the best thing for him would be to
go out and find the round-up, and work with it.
Nothing could have suited Jack better. Hugh was
along as a sort of camp-keeper. Mr. Powell and
Charley Powell were sure to be there, and so were
half a dozen other men whom Jack knew very well,
and with whom he would be glad to work. He felt
that he was going to have a good time. In fact, he
was having a good time now. The air was fresh
and cool, the sun bright; far off on the green hills he
could see here and there a little white speck which
he knew was an antelope; from the fence posts along
which he passed sounded the clear whistle of the
western meadow lark; and everywhere the air was full
of sweet songs of birds, though of them all the
meadow lark's was the loudest and clearest.</p>

<p>Jack's outfit was that commonly used by the cow
puncher. He wore a flannel shirt and woolen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>trousers, gloves, and shaps&mdash;heavy leather trousers
without any seat, to protect the legs when riding
through underbrush or thorns. About his waist was
his pistol-belt filled with cartridges, while the six-shooter
hung well down on his right hip.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that Jack carried a gun
with any purpose of using it against his fellow men,
but in those old days of wild prairie and wild cattle
a pistol was almost a necessity. While sometimes
it was used to kill game, or perhaps against dangerous
animals, it often came in play to frighten an angry
cow, or to turn a bunch of stampeding cattle.</p>

<p>Before long Jack had left behind him the pasture
fence, and when he looked back could no longer see
the ranch buildings which, low themselves, and placed
in a sheltered hollow, were now cut off by the points
of the rounded hills. His course lay southeast across
the basin. Now and then the horses, uncertain as
to the direction they should take, veered to one side
or the other, so that the driver had to ride out on the
side toward which they turned and shout at them to
head them back.</p>

<p>The miles passed quickly. Occasionally, on some
nearby hill Jack saw a little bunch of antelopes&mdash;old
males with long black horns, and yearlings, both
males and females. They looked at him as he drew
near, and if he approached too close, ran up to the
top of some rise and watched him long after he had
passed.</p>

<p>It was after he had crossed the valley, and was riding
up through the low foothills that stretched out
from the bluffs on the other side, that an old doe
antelope burst suddenly from a little coulée close to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>the bunch of horses, and passing in front of them
galloped up the hill on the other side. Almost immediately
behind her was a coyote running hard.
When it saw the horses it checked itself, and an instant
later as it saw the rider, turned and ran. The
old doe had done her best, but except for the incident
of the horses' being there, she would soon have
been pulled down. Her black tongue hung far out
of her mouth, and she staggered as she ran.</p>

<p>Jack understood very well what was happening.
Evidently two or more coyotes had started this doe,
and were taking turns chasing her, one relieving the
other which, by cutting off the corners, could save
itself, and after it had regained its wind, take up the
chase again. So the race might have kept up for
an hour or more, until finally, the old doe would have
been overtaken, pulled down, and devoured.</p>

<p>To Jack all this was a matter of common knowledge,
for more than once he had seen almost that very
thing happen. It took him only a moment, therefore,
to whirl his horse. Giving him a jab with the spurs,
he was close upon the coyote almost before it had
started to run. He had jerked out his six-shooter,
and as two or three balls knocked up puffs of dust
about the coyote, the beast put on a tremendous spurt
of speed. It was impossible to take aim from the
back of the galloping horse, but one ball passing over
the coyote's head caused it to whirl and run broadside
for a jump or two, and as it did this, it came in collision
with another ball, which quickly ended its career.</p>

<p>"Good enough!" said Jack to himself. "That is
better luck than I deserved. I didn't hope to do
more than scare the beast, and now I have got it."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>He rode over and sat on his horse looking down at
the coyote, from whose hide great patches of fur
had been lost, for the animals were now just shedding
their winter coats. Evidently the hide was not worth
taking off, and so Jack dismounted and cut off the
coyote's head, for in those days there was a bounty
on these beasts, and the bounty was worth having.
He tied the head to the saddle, remounted, and started
down toward his horses. They had stopped and were
now feeding, but before long he had them moving
again.</p>

<p>Riding steadily and fast across the plateau, he saw
to his left something moving, and watching it for
a few moments saw that it was a badger digging its
hole. Every now and then the badger would sit up
and look about him, and then again would put its
forefeet on the ground and begin to dig. When he
had got as close to the badger as the trail would bring
him, Jack suddenly turned Pawnee and galloped toward
the creature at a good rate. The badger at
once noticed the change of direction, and set to work
digging harder. By the time Jack had reached the
hole, the animal was already twelve or fifteen inches
under ground, and was quite covered by the loosened
earth of the hole. For a moment Jack was going to
shoot down through the earth, which was heaving and
moving from the struggles of the beast below, but
then it occurred to him that there was no especial
reason for doing this, since the badger could not be
used in any way. Its hide would be useless, and there
was no reason for killing it. Moreover, badgers kill
a good many prairie dogs which eat grass, and gophers
which destroy gardens, and every badger killed means
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>an increase in the dog and gopher population. There
came to him, too, the memory of what Hugh more
than once had said to him&mdash;that there was no sense
in killing things unless you could make some use of
them. He watched the moving earth for two or
three minutes. If he had had a stick he would have
poked it down in the hole, to feel the badger, but he
had seen too many badgers to be willing to put his
hand down in this hole, even though the hand were
protected by a stout glove.</p>

<p>Presently he was on his horse again, and the bunch
was once more started on the road toward Powell's
ranch. The horses, which had been going all day,
were now very willing to stop, and were eager at any
moment to get a bite of grass. Jack kept them to
their work, however, and a little later, when he came
to the edge of the plateau, he was glad to see the
valley below him and Powell's ranch buildings in the
distance. He rode down toward the houses, following
the little sag; but as he went down the hill the
Powell buildings were no longer in sight, for they
were hidden by the ridges on either side the road.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At the Powell ranch it was long after noon; dinner
was over; the dishes had been put away and Mrs.
Powell and Bess were sewing in the living-room. All
the men had gone off on the round-up, and these two
were left here alone, as so often they had been left
alone before. Presently Bess glanced through one of
the windows which looked over the road leading from
the valley.</p>

<p>"Here come some people&mdash;a couple of men and
a pack horse," she said to her mother.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>
<p>A little later the riders drew up in front of the
house, and one of them dismounting came to the
kitchen door and knocked. Bess went to the door
and saw there a tall, spare, middle-aged man. There
was nothing especially noticeable about him except
that he had rather keen, fierce eyes, a hooked nose,
and a black, drooping mustache. As she opened the
door he nodded and said to her:</p>

<p>"How do you do, ma'am? We men are traveling
south to go to the railroad. We've got to get to
Cheyenne. We've come quite a way from the north,
and we've run plumb out of grub. We haven't any
money, more'n just enough for our tickets, and I was
wondering if you would give us a meal. If we can
get something to eat, we can go in comfortably to
town and catch the east-bound passenger to-night."</p>

<p>"Why, certainly!" said Bess. "We'll be glad to
give you something to eat. Tie up your horses and
come in and sit down. It won't take long to get you
some dinner."</p>

<p>Leaving the door open, she went back to her mother
and told her what the riders wanted, and the two
women went into the kitchen and began to start the
fire and to prepare a meal. Meantime the men tied
up their horses and seated themselves just outside
the kitchen door. Mrs. Powell asked once if they
would not come in, and sit in the living-room, but they
said no, they were comfortable there.</p>

<p>Presently dinner was ready and the men, called in,
ate hungrily of bacon, potatoes and bread and butter,
and seemed especially to enjoy the coffee. The young
man had nothing to say; but the older one, after he
had satisfied his hunger, talked a little about matters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>up north, told of things that were happening at Buffalo,
and spoke of having passed a round-up camp
early that morning.</p>

<p>"That's where our men folks are," said Mrs. Powell.
"They're all off riding the country, and won't
be back until the round-up is over."</p>

<p>When the men had finished their meal, the older
one thanked Mrs. Powell; and going outside, the two
sat down by the door and lighting their pipes talked
in low tones. Mrs. Powell and Bess cleared off the
table, washed and put away the dishes, and returned
to the living-room.</p>

<p>Presently the older of the two men rose to his feet
and said to the younger:</p>

<p>"Come on, now! We may as well try it! It'll
be a big help to us if we can get a little money; and
we can get on the train, and be well out of the country
before anybody knows anything about it."</p>

<p>"Aw, Bill, don't do it," said the younger man;
"these people have been good to us. It'll be mighty
mean to frighten 'em, or take anything from 'em."</p>

<p>"Hold your yawp!" growled the man called Bill.
"If they've got anything, I'm going to have it; and
you've got to back me up and stand half the blame!"
He rested his hands on his hips, and looked fiercely
at his companion, who dolefully got up on his feet
and followed Bill into the house. At the door of
the living-room Bill stopped.</p>

<p>"I told you, ma'am," he said, "that we're going to
the railroad, and that we're going to Cheyenne, but
we ain't got any money to pay the railroad fares, and
I thought I'd ask you if you wouldn't give us what
we need?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>
<p>"Is the man crazy!" cried Mrs. Powell, angrily.
"I'm not a bank; and if you've been any time in this
country you must know that people on ranches don't
keep money. What would we spend money for
here?"</p>

<p>"I reckon that's so, ma'am," said Bill; "but I
reckon too that your man didn't go away and leave
you without a cent, and whatever you've got, I'll take,
and take it quick!"</p>

<p>He stepped into the room toward Mrs. Powell, and
she saw at once that the man meant what he said and
that asking for money was no longer a request but a
demand.</p>

<p>"Honestly," she protested, "I have no money.
When Mr. Powell went away he didn't expect us to
leave the ranch, and he knew we didn't need any money
here. You'll have to try to borrow some in town
when you get to the railroad."</p>

<p>"Well," said the man, "if you haven't any money
you've got a watch there, and I'll take that, and maybe
when I get to town I can borrow two or three dollars
on it."</p>

<p>He stepped forward and reached out to take from
her belt a little watch whose ring he could see above
her apron strings; but Mrs. Powell drew back.</p>

<p>"You shan't have that watch!" she cried. "I've
had that ever since I was married, and I won't give
it to you!"</p>

<p>The man caught her arm with his left hand and
reached for the watch with his right hand; and Mrs.
Powell screamed.</p>

<p>"Hold on!" said Bessie. "Let go my mother!
I've got some money, and I'll give it to you."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>
<p>"You've got some money, have you?" said Bill,
releasing Mrs. Powell's arm.</p>

<p>"Yes; I have twenty-two dollars I was saving up
to buy a saddle, and if you will clear out right off,
I'll give it to you."</p>

<p>"All right," agreed Bill. "We'll go. Let's have
it. But don't try to play any tricks, young woman."</p>

<p>"I'll get it for you right away," Bessie said; "it's
here in my bedroom."</p>

<p>"All right," repeated Bill. "Be quick about it!"</p>

<p>Bessie ran into the bedroom and was heard to
pull open a drawer, and a few seconds later a shot
sounded. Bill staggered a little, felt for his pistol,
and then turned around and fell to the floor; while
the young man who had stood in the door ran out
through the kitchen, jumped on his horse, and galloped
off.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br /><br />

<small><small>A ROBBER TURNED LOOSE</small></small></h2>


<p>As Jack rounded a low point of hill only half a mile
from the house, he saw the buildings again. The sun
was getting low, and he decided that he would put
the animals in Powell's pasture and ask Mrs. Powell
to keep him over night at the house. He wondered
if she would know him, for since she had last seen
him he had grown, as it seemed to him, a foot or two.
As he came in sight of the house he noticed, hitched
to the fence near the door, two riding horses and a
loaded pack horse. Evidently there were visitors at
the house. They were travelers, not cow punchers,
for the pack animal carried a sawbuck pack-saddle and
a very small pack.</p>

<p>These thoughts had just passed through Jack's head,
when to his amazement he heard a shot which seemed
to come from the house, and an instant later the door
flew open and a man burst out, rushed to the horses,
jumped on one of them and galloped fast down the
road toward him. Jack could not conceive what this
meant&mdash;shooting in Powell's house. He did not
know the man who was approaching. He was young,
fair-haired, rode like one accustomed to the saddle,
and had a good horse, though it looked as though it
had gone a long way. The rider was coming directly
toward him, and, as he rode, he looked back at the
house two or three times, as though fearing pursuit.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>
<p>Jack did not know what all this meant, and yet one
thing seemed certain&mdash;he must stop this man and
find out what he had been doing. Yet to stop a man
on the road he knew was pretty serious business, and
might very likely lead to shooting. He had traveled
enough on the prairie and had associated enough with
older men to be cautious about getting into trouble;
but here was a case where trouble seemed to be coming
toward him so straight that he could not avoid
it. For the first two or three moments the rider
seemed not to notice Jack, but when he did so, he
checked the speed of his horse, and looked uncertainly
to right and left, as though seeking some way of escape.
By this time Jack had stuck his spurs into Pawnee,
and was riding fast toward the approaching man.
He had his hand on his six-shooter, ready to draw
it at the least sign of trouble. As they drew near
to each other the young man made a motion as if
to put his hand on his pistol butt, but Jack called to
him sharply, "Hands up!" and drew his pistol. The
young fellow's hands flew up in the air, while he
stopped his horse. Jack rode around and coming up
behind him on the right side, still holding his pistol
ready, reached over and took the young man's gun
out of his holster, and then ordered him sharply to
turn around and ride in front of him toward the
house. He watched him closely, for it was possible
that somewhere about his person the man might have
another pistol, but the young fellow seemed to have no
desire to do anything save what he was told. His
nerve had wholly left him.</p>

<p>They trotted up to the door of the ranch, and Jack
called out for Mr. Powell, Charley and Mrs. Powell,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>and a moment later a tall, handsome, brown-haired girl
appeared at the door, holding a six-shooter in her hand.
Jack instantly recognized her as his old friend Bessie,
but Bessie grown out of all likeness to the slim-legged
little girl that he had known half a dozen years before.</p>

<p>"Hello, Bessie!" called Jack. "You don't know
me, I guess, but I am Jack Danvers, just over from
Mr. Sturgis' ranch. I heard a shot and saw this man
running away from the house, and stopped him.
What has happened? Do you want him, or shall I
let him go?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Jack," Bessie answered; "we'll
have to think about that. He ought to be tied up for
a while anyhow, until we can tell you what has happened,
and can decide what to do."</p>

<p>"Well," said Jack, "the first thing is to take his
weapons if he has any. Here is the six-shooter he
had when I stopped him. Will you hold it, and keep
an eye on him while I search him? You used to be
able to shoot when you were a little girl."</p>

<p>"I guess you will think I can yet, Jack," said Bessie.
Jack now noticed that she looked very white.
"That man's partner is in here, and we will have to
do something with him."</p>

<p>Jack said nothing, but dismounted, went to the
young rider, unbuckled and took off his belt and felt
him all over to see whether he had another pistol.
Nothing was found on him more dangerous than a
pocket-knife, which Jack took. He had the young man
dismount and sit down on the ground, and asked
Bessie to stand guard over him. Then with a rope
taken off one of the horses he tied the man's hands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>and feet securely, and passing the rope from his
wrists, which were tied behind his back, over a bar of
the fence four feet from the ground, drew up the
hands so as to keep the man's body bent forward, and to
give him very little freedom of motion. Then he tied
the horses to the fence and went to the door where
Bessie stood.</p>

<p>"Tell me all about it now, Bessie," he said.</p>

<p>"No, Jack, I can't talk now," she replied. "Go in
and speak to mother, and talk it over with her."</p>

<p>He passed through the kitchen and into the living-room,
and the first thing that caught his eye there was
a man lying on the floor, on his back, with one arm
stretched out. Stepping up to him, Jack saw that he
was dead, and apparently he had been moved a little, for
on the boards was a smear of blood, leading to the
man's body, which seemed to show that an effort had
been made to drag him toward the door. Mrs. Powell
was not there, but when Jack called her by name she
opened a bedroom door and came out. Jack began to
tell her who he was, but she knew him at once, and
grasping both his hands began to cry and to tell him
how glad she was to see him.</p>

<p>"Don't cry, Mrs. Powell," said Jack. "Tell me
what all this is about, for of course I don't understand
it at all. I heard a shot, and met a man riding hard
away from the house. I stopped him and brought him
back and now he is outside tied up, with Bessie watching
him."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jack!" moaned Mrs. Powell, "to think that
anything like this could happen in this country! We
have plenty of bad men here, but I never thought that
any of them would be bad enough to attack a woman;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>and I never supposed that Bessie would have to kill
one." The poor woman had great difficulty in speaking,
and it was hard for Jack to understand what she
was talking about; but some ideas he got. He patted
her shoulder and told her that the trouble was
all over now, and she need not worry about it, and
that he would look after everything, if she would
only tell him the whole story so that he could understand
it. Then Mrs. Powell told him what had
happened.</p>

<p>"Well, well," declared Jack, "this is certainly bad
business&mdash;that anybody in this country should start
in and rob women and children. However, it is
mighty lucky that Bessie is so quick with her wits,
and so quick with her gun. Now what shall we do
with this man's partner?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Powell began to cry again.</p>

<p>"Dear me! dear me! I don't know what to say
to you, Jack. If our men come back and find him
here, he surely will never get off the place; they'll hang
him on the gate-post; and I don't want that to happen.
We've had trouble enough with this dead man
here, and I don't want Charley or his father to get
mixed up in any lynching."</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Powell," Jack replied, "this young
fellow ought to be killed and killed quick. He surely
has no business in this country. But I can understand
how you feel. It wouldn't be very pleasant
for you to have him hung right in your dooryard,
as you might say. Let me go out and talk to Bessie,
and see what she thinks. I have an idea from the
way she looks and from what you tell me that she has
pretty good sense; but first, it seems to me, we ought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>to get rid of this carcass here. I'll open the front
door and drag him out."</p>

<p>Jack opened the door, and then going back to where
the man lay, and moving the furniture out of the way,
took him by the two wrists and dragged him out of
the door and left the body lying on the ground.</p>

<p>Going back to the kitchen door, he saw Bessie leaning
against the fence watching the young man who
was seated on the ground, and who apparently had
not changed his position since he was tied up.</p>

<p>"Come over here, Bessie," Jack requested, and she
walked with him to a place fifteen or twenty yards
from the young man, and there in a low voice they
talked over the situation. Jack told her that her
mother had explained what had happened, and of
Mrs. Powell's fear lest some of the people now off on
the round-up should come back and find the prisoner
at the house, and should hang him without ceremony.</p>

<p>"That is what I am afraid of, Jack. I want to
have this thing ended now, as quickly as possible. It
seems terrible that I should have had to kill that
man; but I didn't know what else I could do to protect
mother, and nobody knows where he would have
stopped if something had not been done."</p>

<p>"Well," suggested Jack, "what's the matter with
giving this young man his horse, or horses, and turning
him loose now without any weapons?"</p>

<p>"I wish with all my heart you would do that. It
seems to me that is the easiest way, and the best way,
and it will certainly keep out of trouble any of the
boys that may turn up here in the next few days."</p>

<p>"All right," said Jack, "we'll do that. But first
I've got to use him for a little while, and you must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>come along too, I am afraid, to stand guard over him."</p>

<p>"I'll do anything I can that you say is right,"
agreed Bessie.</p>

<p>Jack went over to the prisoner, and untying the
ropes turned him loose.</p>

<p>"Now, young fellow," Jack said, "rub your arms
and wrists and get the stiffness out of them, and then
come down to the barn and help me hitch up a
wagon."</p>

<p>They went to the barn and found there a couple of
work horses, and harnessing them, hitched them to
the wagon, into which they threw a pick and a couple
of shovels. Driving up to the house, they stopped by
the body of the man who had been shot, and lifted
it into the wagon, covering it with a piece of an old
tent. They then drove off up a ravine a mile or more
from the house, where they stopped the wagon; and
here in the side of a bank the two men dug a hole,
and buried the would-be robber. Jack searched his
pockets for some means of identification, but found
in them nothing except a pipe, some tobacco, matches
and a pocket-knife. His belt and cartridges were
taken off to be carried back to the house.</p>

<p>The sun was close to the western horizon when
they reached the house again. Jack left the young
man unhitching the horses, and Bess watching him,
while he returned to the house to tell Mrs. Powell
what they had decided to do, and to ask her approval.</p>

<p>"That is the very best thing that can be done," she
said. "Start him off for the railroad, and try to see
that he gets there."</p>

<p>"I mean to ride with him for a mile or two," said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>Jack; "and I shall say to him that to-morrow morning
I am going over to the round-up camp to tell them
there what has happened, and that there is likely to be
a hunt for him, and he had better quit the country as
fast as he knows how."</p>

<p>"Good!" approved Mrs. Powell. "Ride with him
over to the big hill, and from there watch him as far
as you can, and then come back. We'll have supper
ready by dark and we'll look for you then."</p>

<p>"All right," replied Jack. "Before I go, though, I'll
turn my horses into the pasture, if you will let me,
and take my bed off the pack horse."</p>

<p>It took scarcely five minutes to do this, for the
hungry horses were still feeding close to the house.
Then Jack went to the young man, who had returned
to the place where he had been tied, and had seated
himself on the ground there.</p>

<p>"You've got yourself into a place that will mean
hanging for you, if you don't get out of the country
quick," said Jack. "I am going to give you a chance
for your life, and let you get to the railroad, where
maybe you can strike a freight, or a passenger-train,
that will take you away. If any of the people that
belong in this part of the country come back and hear
what you and your partner have done, they will start
out and hunt you as long as they can find your tracks,
and if they get hold of you, you'll swing. Who was
this man that you came down here with, and where
did you come from?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what his name was," answered the
young man, "but up there we called him Bill Davis.
We came down from just south of Buffalo. Davis
had a little place up there with a few head of cattle and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>horses on it, but the stockmen thought he was branding
too many calves, and they told him that he would
have to get out of the country. When he saw they
meant it, he came to me, for I had been living on a
little place I had taken up not far from him, and said
that he had to get out, and proposed to me to go somewhere
and make a stake, and come back with something
to put on our places. He persuaded me, and I
went with him. I never knew he was going to try to
rob these people here; they treated us awful white;
but he said to me that if I didn't come with him to
speak to the women, he and I would quarrel. I wish
I had never seen him! I never got into trouble like
this before. You can see for yourself that I ain't bad.
Didn't I give up just as soon as you told me to?" The
young man whimpered and looked as if he were going
to cry.</p>

<p>"Well," admitted Jack, "you don't look to me like a
fellow who would willingly be mixed up in robbing
women and children, and I am going to let you go;
but if I do, you've got to get out of the country quick,
for if the men around here find you, they won't stop
to talk to you, the way I have. The best thing for
you to do is to ride into the railroad and get on a
train and get out of reach as quickly as you can.
Have you any money?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have a five-dollar bill and some nickels."</p>

<p>"What about these horses? Who owns them?"
asked Jack.</p>

<p>"One saddle horse and the pack horse belonged to
Bill; and the horse I ride is mine, and so is the saddle."</p>

<p>"Well," said Jack, "you'd better get on your horse
now and pull your freight for the railroad as quick
as you can. I expect your horse isn't in very good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>shape to make the ride, and maybe I'd better lend you
one of mine to go in with. Do you know anybody
at the railroad that would buy your horse and saddle?"</p>

<p>"Nary a person," was the answer. "I have never
been down here before. The only thing that I can do
is to leave the horse and saddle in town at some livery
stable, or else turn him loose on the range."</p>

<p>"I will tell you what I'll do," said Jack; "if you
want to sell that saddle for twenty dollars, I will buy
it from you, and give you five dollars on account. You
can leave it with Brown, at Medicine Bow, and if I
hear that you have done so, and you will write to me,
I will send you the fifteen dollars by mail. I think
I'll keep Davis' horses and saddle here until somebody
calls for them, and maybe your horse. You can take
one of my string to ride into the railroad, and when
you get there with it, either leave it at Brown's, or
turn it loose on the range. It will come back to our
ranch sooner or later. Now go and change your saddle
to that gray horse you see feeding out there, just
inside the pasture gate. I'll ride with you a little way."</p>

<p>The boy went over to his horse and mounted and
Jack followed on Pawnee. In a moment a rope was
on the gray, the saddles were changed and the two
young men rode off in the direction of the railroad.</p>

<p>When they reached the top of the hill a couple of
miles from the ranch, Jack pointed out to the man the
way he should go to strike the main road leading into
the town, and told him to go ahead. The young man
hesitated for a moment.</p>

<p>"I don't rightly know how to thank you for turning
me loose in this way," he said. "I swear that I
never had any idea of hurting those two women, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>I hope some day I'll be able to make you believe that.
Will you tell me how I may call you?"</p>

<p>"I am Jack Danvers; and you can always reach me
by writing to the Swift Water Ranch, near Carbon.
If you write me, I'll send you the fifteen dollars. What
is your name?"</p>

<p>"I'm Sam Williams, I'm from Michigan; and I
wish't I was back there now. Have you got a piece
of paper? I'd like to have your address written down,
so that I'll remember it."</p>

<p>Jack tore a scrap from an old envelope in his pocket,
and writing the address, handed it over to the young
man.</p>

<p>"Good-by, and thank you again," the latter said;
and turning his horse's head rode to the south.</p>

<p>The sun had set, and it would soon be too dark to
see far, but Jack drew back from the crest of the hill
and, riding around a short distance, dismounted.
Walking up, he peered over the ridge and watched the
horseman, riding fast, until dusk had fairly settled
down over the valley. Then turning, he mounted
Pawnee, and in a short time was at the Powell's barn,
where he unsaddled and turned his horse into the hay
corral.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>



<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br /><br />

<small><small>TO THE ROUND-UP CAMP</small></small></h2>


<p>Supper smelled good to Jack as he entered the
house on his return, for he had had nothing to eat
since breakfast, and the ride had sharpened his appetite.
Mrs. Powell and Bess were putting the food on
the table, and Jack was sent to Charley's room to
wash his hands. He noticed as he passed through
the sitting-room that all was in order, and that here
and there the floor was damp, showing that it had
been scrubbed after he left.</p>

<p>When they sat down to the table, Jack's first words
were:</p>

<p>"Well, he got off all right, and I watched him for a
mile or two. He was going fast toward town, and
I reckon we won't see him again in this part of the
country. What did you do with the other horses,
Bess?"</p>

<p>"I took the saddles off, and turned them into the
pasture with your string. The two saddle horses are
good ones, but I don't know what we ought to do with
them."</p>

<p>During the evening much of the talk was about the
exciting events of the day, though several times the
women tried to get away from the subject by asking
Jack about his life in the East and his studies, or by
discussing the daily happenings of ranch life.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>
<p>It was getting late, and Jack was thinking about
excusing himself and going to bed, when he noticed
that Bessie was holding her head to one side and apparently
listening; and in a few seconds Jack heard
the faint tramp of a galloping horse, which presently
stopped at the barn.</p>

<p>"I'll just go out and see who that is," said Jack.</p>

<p>"You needn't bother, Jack; I know that gallop,"
Bessie replied. "That's old Kate; and probably father
riding her."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Jack. "All the same I'll just
go out and make sure."</p>

<p>He stepped out of the front door and walking
around the unlighted side of the house stopped near
the kitchen door and looked toward the barn. In a
moment he heard footsteps and the clinking of spurs,
with the sound of shaps rasping as a man walked, and
a moment later recognized Mr. Powell, and stepped
forward to speak to him.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose you know me, Mr. Powell, but
I'm Jack Danvers from over at Mr. Sturgis' place and
I want to say a word to you before you go to the
house."</p>

<p>"Why sure I know you, Jack! That is, I know
your voice; but I don't believe I'd know your body.
Maybe when I get a chance to see your face, I'll recognize
that. Are you out here for the summer?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Powell," was the reply; "but I want to
speak to you now before you go in. There has been
trouble here at the house; bad business, but no great
harm done. It's all over now. Mrs. Powell will tell
you the whole story."</p>

<p>The two shook hands and went into the house.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>Powell kissed his wife and hugged his daughter in a
way that showed how glad he was to see them again.
Then he sat down and looked about, as if expecting
something. Mrs. Powell spoke at once.</p>

<p>"I don't know if Jack told you about what happened
here, Henry; but I was badly scared, and I guess
Bess was, too, only she didn't show it."</p>

<p>"Well," said Powell, "tell me the story. There's
no use in beating about the bush."</p>

<p>Mrs. Powell told him what had happened, and as
her story went on, Powell's face took on a stern, hard
look that promised badly for the criminals, if one of
them should fall into his hands. When the narrative
was ended, he turned to his daughter.</p>

<p>"Well, Bess," he said, "you certainly did the right
thing: and I feel proud that you were so ready and
so plucky. You did well, too," he said to Jack; "but,
as I understand it, the thing was all over when you
stopped the man who was running away. What's become
of him?"</p>

<p>Then Jack took up the story, and told the decision
that had been reached and how it had been carried
out.</p>

<p>"Well," said Powell, "I believe on the whole you
did the right thing. I don't quite think it's what I'd
have done, if I'd been here; but if I'd been here I
should have been mad clear through and would probably
have killed the young fellow offhand."</p>

<p>"That would have been the natural thing to do,"
Jack replied; "but of course it wouldn't have been
the pleasantest thing for Mrs. Powell and Bessie, and
I felt that they had both had a pretty hard time, and
that what they said ought to go."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes," declared Powell, slowly, as if considering
the thing, "you did the right thing. I can see that
now, and I'll feel a good deal surer in the morning.
I'm glad that neither Charley nor any of those young
fellows came on with me from the round-up camp.
If they had, I know they would have caught up fresh
horses and followed that fellow to the railroad, and
very likely caught him before he got on the train.</p>

<p>"Well," he went on, "you've all had a pretty exciting
day, and I expect you women had better go to
bed. I'll sit up here and smoke a pipe or two, and
talk with Jack, and then we'll go to bed too. I'm going
back to the camp in the morning, and I expect
you'll want to go along too, won't you, Jack? I judge
that you're headed for the round-up camp."</p>

<p>"That's where I want to go," agreed Jack. "I
came here because I had an idea the camp would be
somewhere in this neighborhood, and I thought I could
get directions to find it."</p>

<p>After the two women had gone to bed, Powell filled
his pipe and then drawing his chair close to Jack they
talked together for a little while in a low tone. Jack
told his host all that he had learned about the man
who had been killed, and when he mentioned his name,
Powell exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Why, that might have been the Bill Davis that
was mixed up in that train robbing business nearly
ten years ago, the one the miners hung Big-Nose
George for in Rawlins. If that's the man, he surely
was bad, and deserved all he got."</p>

<p>"Well," said Jack, "I went through his clothes
but couldn't find any papers. The young fellow
gave him the name of Davis. He was a man, I should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>think, between forty and fifty, just beginning to get
gray, a hooked-nosed man, with black hair and
mustache."</p>

<p>"I never saw Davis," said Henry Powell; "only
heard of him."</p>

<p>"The young fellow," Jack went on, "didn't seem
to be bad. He seemed to be worthless, and no account.
He had no great amount of sand, and was
always looking around to find some way to get out of
the difficulty."</p>

<p>"I've an idea, then, that he was not mixed up in
the thing any farther than being in bad company."</p>

<p>"That's just what I thought," said Jack, "and I
believe I'm right. Why, when he talked to me when
I turned him loose, he came pretty near crying. I
don't think he's a fellow of any force at all, and I don't
believe that he will ever get back into this part of
the country again."</p>

<p>"Could he get off on the railroad?" asked Powell.
"Did he have any money?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he had five dollars of his own, and I gave
him five more for his saddle, which he said he would
leave at Brown's, and then if he lets me know his address,
I will send him fifteen more by mail. Besides
that, he left his horse here, and it's a better one
than the gray I gave him to ride on. If he gets off
on the railroad he's to leave the horse at Brown's, or
turn it loose on the range. Of course, ten dollars will
carry him some distance, but will leave him afoot
wherever he stops. Still, that's a whole lot better
than being hanged."</p>

<p>"Well," decided Powell, "I guess you did just
right; and I'm glad it all happened as it did. It's a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>mighty lucky thing for the women and me that you
rode up here just as you did. I shouldn't have been
afraid of anything more happening to them, but it
would have been pretty bad for them to have to get
rid of that carcass. Well, let's go to bed."</p>

<p>He stretched out his hand and gave Jack a grip
that made the boy wince, and they went to their
rooms.</p>

<p>Early the next morning Jack and Powell looked over
the horses left there by the strangers the day before.
The men had been well mounted, and the saddle and
bridle belonging to Davis were new, good and strong.
The pack horse was also a good animal, and looked
as if it might have speed and endurance.</p>

<p>"Nice horses, aren't they, Mr. Powell?" said Jack.
"But I don't know who owns them now."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Powell; "they are nice horses.
You'll find, if you live long enough in this country&mdash;maybe
you've found it out already&mdash;that these
rustlers and bad men always do have good horses.
They've always got to be ready to skip off when any
one gets after them, and they always try to be fixed
so as to ride a little faster and a little farther than
the man who is chasing them. So they always have
good horses and good saddles. As to who owns these
horses now, you and I can't say, but I guess nobody
has a better title to them than we two, so we'll just
hold them until somebody comes along and claims
them and proves property. I don't know the brands
of any of them. That one on the brown horse might
be old Missouri John's "beer mug," blotted. If it is,
he'll be along some day and likely know the horse.
Now I've got to get Bessie to write some letters for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>me this morning, and then I want to get some grub
and put it on a horse, and after dinner we can start
back to the round-up camp and get there before dark.
Will that suit you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Jack, "that will suit me to a T;
and I am certainly glad to wait for you, to have company
on the road over."</p>

<p>"Well," said Powell, "that will be good; then we
can turn my pack horse loose and drive him with your
<i>remuda</i>, and we can get along pretty fast."</p>

<p>As he said this, a call from the house told them that
breakfast was ready, and they started back.</p>

<p>"By the way," asked Powell, as they were approaching
the house, "what about those guns that you took
away from the men yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Why," Jack answered, "you may as well keep
them here. I have my own and don't need any more.
I think the pair that Davis wore ought to belong to
Bess."</p>

<p>Powell smiled.</p>

<p>"Well, maybe they ought to. I guess we'll keep
those here, but the one you took from the young
man you might as well keep."</p>

<p>"All right," said Jack, "I will; but of course I don't
want to pack it around with me now. This one I
am carrying came from a horse thief. Do you remember
that time four or five years ago when we ran
into a bunch of stolen stock on the Sweet Water,
and Hugh killed black Bob Dowling? Hugh gave me
his pistols, and ever since then I have worn one of
them whenever I was in a place where I carried a
pistol."</p>

<p>The house this morning looked more cheerful than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>it had the afternoon before. Mrs. Powell and Bess
were bright and smiling, and the breakfast was very
good. Soon after the meal was over, Powell began
the work of writing his letters by his daughter's hand.
Jack went out and strolled about the barns and corrals,
and killed time for several hours, and then coming
back to the house, interrupted the letter writing
by asking Powell if he could not get out the grub
that was to be taken to the camp.</p>

<p>"I wish you would," said Powell, "if you haven't
anything to do. Mrs. Powell will show you where the
stuff is, and all I want to take is a couple of sacks
of flour and two slabs of bacon. You will find pack-saddles
and riggings hanging up in the storeroom
where the grub is, and if you feel like doing it, you
might catch up that sorrel horse that you'll find in
the pasture, the one with two white feet, and either
tie him in the barn, or put him in the small corral,
so that we can get him quick when we are ready to
pack."</p>

<p>"All right," answered Jack, "I'll do that. First
I'll get out the grub and then I'll fix the saddle, and
along just before dinner time I'll go down and get the
horses and bring them up and put them in the corral.
I don't know what horse you're going to ride."</p>

<p>"I'll ride old Kate back again. You know her. She
is the brown, with a bald face and one white hind
foot. Bring them all up to the corral just before
dinner, and then they'll be handy."</p>

<p>It took Jack but a little time to get together the
load for the pack horse and set it outside the storehouse;
then he went to the barn, saddled up Pawnee
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>and rode into Powell's small pasture where he got together
the required horses, and drove them up to the
corral.</p>

<p>Dinner was not so cheerful a meal as breakfast
had been. It seemed to Jack that the women felt a
little nervous about losing their men folk, and before
the meal was over this was so obvious that Powell
spoke about it.</p>

<p>"You women," he said, "don't want to get scared
over nothing. It's my belief that you might rake this
country over with a fine-tooth comb and not find another
man that would act as mean as that Davis did.
You've both of you got good pluck, and have shown
it, and I want you to keep on showing it now. All
the same, if I were you I wouldn't let any strangers
come into the house. People that you know, of
course, are all right, but strangers you had best keep
off. If they ask what's the matter, tell them you
were badly treated once by some strangers, and that
you won't risk it again. You, Bess, had better wear
your six-shooter all the time, unless you see somebody
coming that you know; then I expect you would want
to shed it. Somebody will be coming in from the
round-up every two or three days; and in the course
of a day or two, when this scare you've had wears off,
things will go on just as they've always gone on, and
you'll have a real good time. Now," he added, as he
pushed back his chair, "Jack and me'll go down and
pack them animals, and then we'll roll."</p>

<p>The saddling and packing of the horses took but a
short time, and after the animals had been turned out,
and were feeding on the flat in front of the house,
the men went up to say good-bye. The women clung
to Powell, and seemed loath to let him go, and they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>shook hands with Jack in an earnest, cordial fashion
that greatly pleased him.</p>

<p>"I don't know what we'd have done, Jack Danvers,
if it hadn't been for you," Mrs. Powell said. "We
folks will never forget how you helped us out."</p>

<p>Powell waved his hand, and Jack lifted his hat,
and they rode off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>



<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br /><br />

<small><small>OLD FRIENDS</small></small></h2>


<p>It was almost sunset when Powell and Jack rode
over the hill and saw the round-up camp in the valley,
far below them. There was a big bunch of cattle still
scattered out and feeding, but about them were the
four or five riders who were keeping them together,
and who a little later, and before dark, would bring
them up into a close bunch, to bed them down. Off
to one side was the cávaya, or horse bunch, which
contained the strings of the different riders, six or
seven or eight horses to a man, and the work horses
that were used on the chuck and bed wagons. Lounging
around the camp were the men, apparently waiting
for supper, which the cook announced just before
Powell and Jack reached the camp. The men hurried
up to the tent; each one supplied himself with plate,
cup, knife, fork and spoon, and went over to the
cook-stove and helped himself to food. When Powell
and Jack stopped close to the camp, it was a boisterous
crowd of full-mouthed men who shouted and
waved their hats to them. Every one knew Powell,
and half a dozen recognized Jack, who as a little fellow
had been known to most of them. Jack was
glad to see them all, but his eye roved about, looking
especially for Hugh, who, after the first outbreak,
rose from the ground, where he had been sitting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>filling his pipe, and walked over to Jack and gave him
a cordial hand-clasp.</p>

<p>"Well, son," drawled Hugh, "I'm sure glad to see
you again. It's a long time since we've met, and I
reckon we'll have lots to say to each other, now that
we've got together again."</p>

<p>"You bet we will, Hugh," cried Jack; "and we
can't begin too soon, according to my notion."</p>

<p>A moment later their talk was interrupted by
Charley Powell, who, slapping Jack vigorously on the
back, told him to take off his saddle and turn his
horse loose, for he was going to take the horses over
and turn them into the cávaya. Jack unsaddled and
let his horse go, and then Hugh said to him:</p>

<p>"Go get your supper now, and after you've eaten,
or while you're eating, come out here and set down.
I want to see you and talk to you, even if your mouth
is full and you can't talk to me."</p>

<p>Jack hurried to the cook's tent and presently returned
with a plate heaped high with food, and a cup
of coffee brimming over, so that the steaming fluid
dripped from it at every step. He sat down and began
to eat, while Hugh, whose pipe was now going
well, began to talk.</p>

<p>"Well, son, you've surely growed a heap since
we saw each other last. You're taller now, I reckon,
than I am; but you ain't nigh so thick; the fact is,
it looks as if it was about time for you to stop growing
long, and begin to grow broad, but then I reckon
there's time enough for that, maybe. Do you remember
that last trip we made, when we went up over
the ice in those high mountains in the main range?
Do you remember the time Tony Beaulieu and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>partners shot holes in the tent? And do you remember
that Indian that stopped us over by the crossing
of St. Mary's River and wanted whisky?"</p>

<p>"You bet I remember it all, Hugh," said Jack;
"but I think what I remember best of all is the way
you held Tony Beaulieu and how he burst out crying
when he couldn't get away; and the way old Calf
Robe quirted those Indians that had stopped us."</p>

<p>"Yes, that sure was a good trip," replied Hugh;
"but, then, I don't know as it was better than a
whole lot of other trips we made. That first time,
when we went up to the Piegan country, when you
counted a <i>coup</i>, and you and Joe found that sack of
gold; that must have been a dandy trip for you, because
you were so much younger, and because everything
that you saw was new and strange and exciting.</p>

<p>"Now this summer you're going to have a mighty
quiet time, I reckon, with plenty of hard work; nothing
to see, except ride circle, getting in at night feeling
as if your feet belonged a yard apart; then maybe
going out on night herd, and serenading these cattle,
if a storm comes up and they get anyways uneasy.
No, you can't expect to have much happen in a cow
camp."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know, Hugh," laughed Jack; "there
are lots of things that can happen out in this country
yet. Of course, there's not much except hard work
and grief that happens in a cow camp, and yet there's
some excitement in riding and roping, and there's
always a chance that we may run across a bear and
have some fun with him."</p>

<p>"Well," Hugh replied, "the country is getting
pretty quiet now. Maybe it's because I'm getting old,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>and maybe it's because I've seen a good many things
happen, but I certainly don't get excited the way I used
to."</p>

<p>By this time Jack had finished eating. Putting his
things together, he carried them back to the cook's
tent, and then returned to Hugh, and sat down close
beside him.</p>

<p>"Well, Hugh," he said, "there was something happened
yesterday that I want to tell you about; though
I shouldn't say anything about it to anybody else, unless
it gets to be talked about. You speak about the
country being in a bad way and no good any more, and
sometimes I think you're right. Now something happened
yesterday over at Powell's that I wouldn't have
believed could have taken place in a country where
there are men, and American men at that! It isn't
a thing I want to talk about, but I do want to tell
you about it, and to ask you whether you think what
I did was right. I am not doubtful about it myself,
but I'd like to have your opinion, too."</p>

<p>With that Jack opened his heart and told Hugh all
the events of the day before.</p>

<p>The story finished, Hugh sat for some time without
speaking, looking at his pipe which had gone out while
he listened. At last he raised his eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, son, I think that what you did was the wisest
possible thing to have done. Of course you didn't
have much choice in the matter. You were bound to
do whatever Mrs. Powell and little Bess said that
they wanted done, but as it happens what they wanted
done was the best thing that could have been done.
It surely would have been mighty uncomfortable for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>those two women&mdash;as nice women as I ever saw&mdash;to
have a man lynched on their account, as you
might say, right close to the house. It was up to
you to help them out of that scrape, and you did it
sensibly and well. I'm not a mite surprised at
Bessie's killing that man. She's a mighty smart little
girl; thinks quick and acts quick. I expect if she
hadn't shot as she did, there's no telling what amount
of deviltry those two men might have been up to."</p>

<p>"You're right, Hugh, she's plucky and a good shot,
and she must have been mighty quick to think what
to do; but, I tell you, it made her feel mighty bad to
be obliged to do it, and for a while after she had shot
she looked as white as a ghost."</p>

<p>"Davis?" reflected Hugh. "I am trying to see if
I can't recollect that name. What sort of looking
fellow was the one that got killed?"</p>

<p>"He looked like 'most anybody else, except that he
had a more or less hooked nose, and a black mustache.
Mrs. Powell said that his eyes looked sharp and
snappy, and sort of cruel; but of course I didn't see
his eyes."</p>

<p>"I was wondering," said Hugh. "Years ago,
down in old Nebraska, I used to know a cow puncher
named Bill Davis, and he might have been this man.
The description fits him well enough, but I don't
know as it makes much difference, seeing he's dead.
You say you didn't find any letters or papers on
him."</p>

<p>"Nothing; nothing except a pipe and tobacco and
matches, and a little small change."</p>

<p>"Of course, you don't know anything of what
become of the other fellow?"</p>

<p>"Nothing more than what I have told you," said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>Jack. "He started for the railroad, and that's the
last I saw of him."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you ever will see him; unless he
writes you for the fifteen dollars you owe him. He
may do that; but, somehow, I think likely he'll be too
scared even to do that."</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Jack; "he seemed mightily
afraid of the business end of the six-shooter, but he
didn't seem very much afraid of me; he seemed kind
of sorry rather than afraid. Well, it's Powell's business,
and not mine, and I am not going to say anything
about it. If he wants to speak of it, all right."</p>

<p>"I've heard of mighty few people getting into trouble
by keeping their mouths shut," said Hugh, "but
of a whole lot that have come to grief from talking
too much. You'll be all right, I think, to keep quiet."</p>

<p>Jack stood up.</p>

<p>"I guess I'll go over and speak to Mr. McIntyre,
and get my work laid out for the next two or three
days," he said. "He may want me to go on night
herd to-night. I suppose there are plenty of fellows
who will be mighty glad to get off."</p>

<p>Jack's guess was a good one. The round-up foreman
was glad to see him, of course&mdash;glad to get a
new hand, and a fresh hand. He told Jack that the
best thing he could do now would be to go out and
catch up a horse and take his turn at night herd until
10 o'clock. Then he could come in and get five
or six hours' sleep before they started to ride in the
morning. The cávaya had just been brought in;
and Jack, taking his rope, went out and caught one
of his string and brought it in and saddled it. Pawnee
would have been the horse chosen, but Pawnee had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>already carried him from Powell's to the round-up,
and Jack thought the horse entitled to a little rest.</p>

<p>The night was calm and pleasant, and there seemed
no reason to suppose that anything would disturb the
cattle, so only two boys were sent out to ride around
them at present, relieving the four or five who had
had charge of them during the latter part of the day,
who had now brought them together and waited until
they had finally lain down and were peacefully
chewing the cud under the stars, just then coming
out.</p>

<p>Tulare Joe was Jack's companion: a new acquaintance,
but a nice looking fellow, whose name suggested
that he came from somewhere in California. He was
a man eight or ten years older than Jack, quiet, pleasant,
soft-voiced, and apparently a rider. As the two
approached the cattle they separated and began to
ride around them; and one by one the other riders,
as they met them, exchanged a word or two and turned
their horses in the direction of the camp. Presently
from the other side of the herd, Jack caught the
sound of Joe's voice droning out a song, the words
of which he could not hear; but later, when they were
relieved by other boys, and were riding back to camp,
he asked Joe to teach him the song. Joe said that
he knew only one verse, which ran like this:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh! the cowboy's life is a dreary one,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He works from dawn till the setting of the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And then his work is left undone,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For his night herding then comes on.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sing, who-o, who-o, whoop; cows away;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He works all night and he works all day.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Whoop-i-wo; whoop-i-way;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For very poor chuck and darned poor pay;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
<span class="i1">Sing, whoop-i-whoa who-ay."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After a few days Jack caught the air of this, and
thereafter often sang it when on night herd.</p>

<p>"I don't know why it keeps the cattle quiet," said
Joe, "it certainly ain't the sentiment; and I don't believe
it's the tune. I suppose like as not it gives them
something to think about and keeps them from looking
around, hunting for things to get scared at.
Maybe, too, it gives them confidence when they think
that the men and the horses are right close to 'em
all the time. Anyhow, I've always heard about singing
to the cattle ever since I first forked a horse, and
I've seen sometimes, when cattle were mighty nervous
and uneasy, when the singing seemed to keep them
from breaking away."</p>

<p>Jack slept soundly that night and the call to grub
came all too soon the next morning.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br /><br />

<small><small>CUTTING AND BRANDING</small></small></h2>


<p>The sun was just getting ready to look over the
hills the next morning and the men were hastily bolting
their breakfast, when the horse wrangler brought
up the cávaya to the camp. Before this, some of the
men had driven into the ground five stakes, four of
them marking the four corners of a square of considerable
size, with one stake between two of the corners,
or on one side of this square. A sixth stake
was driven out on the prairie a few yards from one
end of the three stakes in line, and at right-angles to
that line, thus</p>


<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/054.jpg" alt="The cávaya" />
</div>


<p>To the tops of these stakes, which were only three feet
high, were tied ropes which when pulled tight would
make a rope enclosure, complete on three and one-half
of its sides, but with an opening between one of the
corner stakes and the one standing between the two
corners. From one of the corner stakes to the one
standing alone on the prairie, ran another rope, making
a sort of wing which would stop animals tending to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>walk by the corner, and would turn them into the opening.</p>

<p>Down on the plains in old times rope corrals were
often made by tying ropes to the front and hind wheels
of a wagon, and stretching them out at right angles to
the length of the wagon. The horses were driven into
this corral and then caught there. The Texas ponies
of those earlier days were cunning little rascals and
many of them had learned to put the nose down close
to the ground and get the head under the rope and
then raising the head to push out. Of course when
one had got out and rushed away, the others would
follow, pushing down the rope and getting free.
Often the man who was holding the end of the rope,
seeing a horse about to push under, would slacken
the rope until it was under the pony's nose, and then,
giving the rope a quick jerk, it would spring up and
hit the horse, making him throw up his head. In the
mountains such corrals were sometimes used, but
as often those made with the stakes.</p>

<p>The cávaya was driven very slowly toward this
rope corral and some of the boys ran out to it, one
handling the rope which was to act as a wing and the
others the ropes which ran from corner to corner of
the corral. The horse wrangler drove his animals
along at a walk and turned them into the opening of
the corral, the men at the ropes raising them as the
horses entered. The horses stopped and made no
attempt to push against the ropes. After the whole
bunch had entered the corral, the man at the wing
rope walked around and stood by the middle one of
the three stakes in line, thus completely closing the
corral. Ducking under the ropes, the boys now went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>slowly and quietly into the enclosure, and caught the
gentle horses, which, one by one, they led out and
tied. Over the heads of any horses that were not
willing to be caught, ropes were quietly tossed, and
the horses led out.</p>

<p>Jack, who was taking part in all this work, was
interested, as he had been so many times before, in
seeing the remarkable change of demeanor in a horse,
just as soon as it feels a rope on it. The animal
may be wild and frisky&mdash;apparently untamable&mdash;in
the corral, but let the rope drop over its head, and it
is at once transformed into the meekest and most commonplace
of animals.</p>

<p>Of course, this is not true of young colts that have
not been broken, but the horse that has had a few falls,
and has learned the power of the rope, always fears
it.</p>

<p>When all the men had caught up their horses, and
the ropes had been taken from the corral, the rest of
the bunch were allowed to wander off, while the horse
wrangler went to the cook tent to get his breakfast.</p>

<p>Now followed a scene more or less amusing and
exciting, or irritating and tiresome, as one happened to
look at it. Many cow horses, even though well broken,
always object to being saddled, while some object both
to being saddled and to being mounted. Now and
then was found a horse that had to be blinded before
he could be saddled; and occasionally one that refused
to be bridled. The younger men shouted and
made much fun of their fellows who had horses that
were disposed to be nervous, or to object to the saddle.</p>

<p>The older men, when after some trouble they had
succeeded in getting the saddles on their horses, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>the cinches drawn, were likely to lead the animals up
and down by a rope, and let them buck with the empty
saddle.</p>

<p>The horse selected this morning by Tulare Joe was
young, skittish and rather disposed to make trouble.
When Joe approached him, carrying the blanket in
his hand, he reared and sometimes came forward on
his hind legs striking with his forefeet. The young
man was cool and quick, and showed no impatience
whatever, but after a few minutes' fruitless work of
this sort he called to Jack, who was standing looking
on, having saddled his own quiet horse, and asked
him to bring his rope. As Jack approached, Joe
called to him:</p>

<p>"The next time this horse goes up in the air catch
him and throw him for me."</p>

<p>The opportunity came a moment or two later.
Jack threw the rope, from a little behind the horse,
caught it and gave a sidewise tug while the horse
was on its hind legs. The animal fell heavily. Joe
jumped on its head, while Jack quickly looped the
lariat around its hind legs and tied the horse fast.
Without the slightest sign of impatience, Joe lifted
the horse's head, and bridled him, while Jack brought
the saddle; and a moment later, having had the rope
loosed which bound its feet, the half dazed animal
stood up and in a few seconds was saddled.</p>

<p>"Much obliged, Jack," said Joe. "You saved me
a little time, and have cut those fellows out of a
whole lot of the joshing they would have given me
while I was fooling with this horse alone. Then,
too, you had added some to McIntyre's peace of
mind. He thinks the horses brought on a round-up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>ought to be gentled before the round-up starts, and
hates to see time wasted with a horse that is hard
to handle."</p>

<p>"Well, Joe," was the response, "I like the way
you handle your horse. Most of us lose our patience
and kick and swear and pound a horse with a quirt;
and that is something that does no good. I know
years ago, when I was a little fellow, and was first
out here, Hugh used to tell me that the main reason
why a man was better than a horse was that he had
sense, and if he didn't use his sense, why he wasn't
of much account."</p>

<p>Joe laughed.</p>

<p>"You take it from me," he said, "that old man
knows a heap, and if you've been traveling around
with him for some years, like you say you have, I
reckon that you know that a heap sight better than
I can tell you."</p>

<p>By this time most of the men had already started
out toward the large bunch of cattle now scattered over
the prairie, feeding. McIntyre, the foreman, had
given orders to the men as to where the various bunches
were to be held, and the representatives of the different
brands were talking with each other about this.
In this bunch of cattle there were four principal brands,
which must now be separated and divided into four
herds, each one of which would be driven off by
the representatives of the brand. Besides the cattle
bearing these four brands, there were, of course, in
the large bunch a number of strays&mdash;cattle that perhaps
had wandered on to the range from a distance,
or that had been dropped by some one driving a
herd through the country, or that were owned by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>small people, the size of whose bunch did not justify
them in sending a representative with the round-up.
Of these strays many would be recognized by the cow
men present. Those would be turned into the bunch
of cut cattle that would pass nearest to the ranch of
the owner, while others bearing brands unknown to
any of the cow punchers would be kept with the
biggest herd, turned out on the home range of that
bunch, and perhaps watched for a while in the hope
that an owner would turn up. If none was found, the
stock association would be notified and the animal
turned over to it.</p>

<p>As Jack and Joe drew near the big bunch, half a
dozen men were circling around it, bringing it together
in a close, compact mass, while two or three
other riders were urging their horses among the cattle,
scrutinizing the brand which each bore. Most
of the cattle had completely shed their winter coats
and were short-haired and smooth, so that the brands
showed up well and could be read at a considerable
distance.</p>

<p>It was interesting to Jack, as it is to every one who
witnesses it, to see the trained cow horse follow an
animal. There, for example, was a blue roan cow
pushing her way through the thick mass of the herd,
just ahead of the horse ridden by Rube. The horse
was going at a trot and was close to the heels of the
cow, which seemed to push always toward the
place where the cattle were crowded thickest. Presently
Rube got her out from the center of the herd
and over toward the edge, and every time that she
turned to go back toward the center the little horse,
with ears pricked forward, dodged more quickly and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>got in her way. So, little by little, she was edged out
to the border of the bunch; and then it was seen that,
running close by her side and almost under her belly,
was a strong and sturdy calf that must have been born
in March or early April. As soon as the cow had
reached the edge of the herd the little pony galloped
forward, driving straight toward her except when
she tried to break back, and then always getting in her
way. Rube now swung his quirt over his head and
presently the cow, giving up the struggle to return,
started straight off over the prairie to a little bunch
of the Sturgis' cattle that had already been brought
together and that Hugh and another man were keeping
by themselves. Just as the cow reached the edge of
this little bunch, a cow puncher threw his rope and
caught the calf's hind legs; the horse wheeled instantly
and started on a quick gallop, dragging the
calf over the prairie to a fire in which the branding
irons were heating. Here two of the boys jumped
down and held the calf; another snatched a hot iron
from the fire and swiftly put the Sturgis brand on
it. Then, it was turned loose, and hurried back to
the little bunch from which its anxious mother trotted
out with threatening calls, and after nosing it all over
walked back into the crowd.</p>

<p>McIntyre had detailed Jack to act through the day
as one of the calf branders, and all day long he was
busy roping calves, dragging them up to the fire and
helping to hold them down, while some one clapped
on the iron. It was not pleasant work&mdash;the smoke
of singed hair rose from the animal's side, and the
poor creature bawled piteously; but, after all, a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>many painful and disagreeable things have to be done,
and this was one of them.</p>

<p>As the day went by, and Jack got hotter and more
thirsty and more dusty and more tired, he derived
a little amusement from wondering what some of
those eastern pilgrims, who had talked to him of the
romance of the cowboy's life would think of that
life if for one day they had to do the work that the
cowboy has to do every day. No one can imagine
the weary monotony of doing this work over and over
again; the strength that it may take to hold the calf;
the heat from the fires; the cloud of dust, grime and
ashes among which one works; the constant trifling
annoyances of being burned by a hot iron, being kicked
by a frisky calf, or having one's hands hurt by the
rope. All these things, combined with the physical
force that is constantly called into play, make the
work laborious and tiresome. The romance of the
cowboy's life exists only in the imagination. Of
course the boys are cheerful and merry, laughing and
joking all the time, making fun of their own mishaps,
or of those of their neighbors, and this constant flow
of good spirits makes the work far lighter than it
otherwise would be.</p>

<p>Now and then during the day, a little variety was
offered by some cow that, pestered beyond endurance,
at last refused to run any longer and turned to fight.
Such a cow becomes at once a dangerous animal; and
to get her calf away from her, unless it can be frightened
into leaving its mother for a short distance, is
sometimes difficult.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>Jack met with such a cow, which, after wasting a little
energy in charging him, contented herself with
standing still and threatening with her horns, while the
calf stuck close to her side. Two or three times Jack
rode swiftly by her and threw his rope at the calf,
but the little beast stood so close under its mother's
side that in no case did the rope catch it. Jack tried
to ride near enough to the calf to lash it with his
rope, in the hope that this would start it out from its
position of safety, but the attempt was a failure, and
the second time he did this the cow charged him
viciously. He wheeled his horse and got away, but
the long horns swept so close that it gave him a moment's
uneasiness lest his horse should be harmed.
He whirled quickly to get back to the cow, thinking
that possibly the calf might have been left behind,
but this had not happened: it was still close to its
mother.</p>

<p>About this time, Joe swept by him dragging a calf
at the end of his rope, and a few moments later, after
the calf had been turned loose, Joe returned.</p>

<p>"Why, here's my chance to pay you off for what
you did for me this morning," he said to Jack. "Rope
the old cow's horns and I'll take her hind feet and
we'll stretch her."</p>

<p>No sooner said than done. In a moment Jack's
rope settled over the cow's horns, and as she at first
pulled back and then started forward, Joe very cleverly
picked up both her hind feet and turned his horse
the other way; instantly the cow was stretched out
helpless on the prairie. Jack made his rope fast to
the horn of his saddle, and left his horse to hold the
cow while he ran back to her. Joe in the meantime
rode forward toward the cow's head, thus bringing her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>hind feet up under her breast; and in a moment she
was securely tied. The calf had run off a few yards,
and stood there bewildered.</p>

<p>"There's your calf," said Joe, as he swung into the
saddle again. "Go and brand him."</p>

<p>Jack freed his rope from the cow's head, rode over
and caught the calf, and when it was branded, dragged
it back to its mother. Then he untied the cow and,
hopping into the saddle before she regained her feet,
was soon off after another calf.</p>

<p>So the day went on: a long day filled with fun,
jollity, laughter, provoking incidents and irritating
happenings; so that at night when the men returned to
camp they were all weary and enormously hungry.
The representatives of each one of the four different
brands drove off their cattle to some distance from
the main herd, and watched them while they fed and
drank, filling their bellies for the night.</p>

<p>A little later these representatives would be relieved
by the night herders who now, with several
herds to watch instead of one as the night before,
would ride about and keep apart the different bunches.</p>

<p>Hungry and tired as they were, a number of the
punchers, instead of going directly to camp, rode down
in the stream-bed well below the camp and there
stripping off their upper clothing whipped the dirt out
of it as best they could, and scrubbed their white
healthy bodies free from the dust that had sifted
through their shirts. The effort to get the grime and
sand from their hair was hopeless, except for those
men who had been thoughtful enough before starting
out on the round-up to have their hair clipped
short, and of these there were only two or three.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>
<p>By the time they reached camp, supper was ready,
and it was a ravenous lot of cow punchers who
scrambled for plates, cups, and knives and forks, and
enjoyed the hearty, wholesome food that simmered on
the fire.</p>

<p>At length, stuffed to repletion, Jack threw himself
on the ground near Hugh.</p>

<p>"I feel like a boa-constrictor that has eaten an ox,"
he laughed.</p>

<p>"Well," replied Hugh, "I guess you're stuffed
pretty full. It's hard work branding calves, and it's
work that you ain't used to right now. It won't be
so hard on you a week or two from this, when you've
got more into the run of things."</p>

<p>"Of course you're right," said Jack. "I have not
done any work just like this for a good while, and
it does seem hard and tiresome now, but it's like 'most
everything else: we'll get used to it after a while."</p>

<p>"I reckon you didn't see Vicente get chucked to-day,
did you?" asked Hugh. "No," he went on,
"I'm sure you didn't, because you were over there
by the fire when it happened. He tried to throw a
cow, and when he stopped his horse the saddle cinch
broke and he went a-flyin'. It didn't hurt him none,
but he was pretty mad."</p>

<p>"Why, how did it come to break?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>"That was the funny part of it. You know he
only came in day before yesterday, and coming down
through the mountains the night before he got here,
they camped, and along in the night Vicente was waked
up by hearing a porcupine walking around camp. Of
course, he thought of his saddle at once, and got
up out of his blankets. It was bright moonlight and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>in a minute he saw the porcupine close to his saddle.
He grabbed up a stick of firewood&mdash;he had got in
late and cooked his supper with just a few odds and
ends of brush and limbs that he had picked up around
camp&mdash;and with one of these sticks he went for the
porcupine. The stick was no good and broke the
first time he hit the animal, and it ran off
into the brush.</p>

<p>"Vicente knew it would come back, and he got
a stout club so as to kill it if it bothered him. Then
he took his saddle to bed with him and tried to stay awake;
but he didn't stay awake. Presently he heard
the porcupine whimpering about his bed, and he
jumped up and mighty soon pounded the life out of
the beast. He looked at his saddle the next morning,
and it seemed to him to be all right, and he rode
down the hill with it and didn't have occasion to use
it hard until to-day.</p>

<p>"When he looked at it, after he got chucked, he
found that that blasted porcupine had just taken a
nip or two at the string that tied the latigo to the ring
of the saddle. Maybe there was a little salt in that
string from the horse sweat, or maybe it was just
an accident. Anyhow, the string was cut enough so
that when a pull came the saddle flew, and Vicente
with it."</p>

<p>"Well, I am glad that he killed the porcupine,"
said Jack. "They are pretty useless beasts, according
to my way of thinking."</p>

<p>"I don't think much more of them than you do;
but up in some parts of the North the Indians think
they are about the finest eating there is, and I reckon
the Indians' clothing in old times wouldn't have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>half as fancy as it used to be if it hadn't been for
porcupine quills. You know in old times, before the
Indians got glass beads by trading with the white
folks, they used to use quills and feathers and hair,
and sometimes black roots, to ornament their clothes,
and their lodges. Of course, they dyed the quills or
feathers, and the roots too, all sorts of colors, and
made their moccasins and leggings and shirts and robes
real pretty."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jack; "I have seen buffalo robes that
were handsomely worked with quills; and up there
in the Piegan country pretty nearly half the shirts,
and a good part of the pipe stems, were ornamented
with quills."</p>

<p>"That's so," said Hugh. "The Piegans are great
fellows to use quills, and so are the Cheyennes."</p>

<p>"That's one thing I want to ask you about, Hugh:
how they colored all these different things yellow and
red. Of course they didn't have to dye the quills
black, because most of them are part black already."</p>

<p>"Well," Hugh promised, "we'll have a talk about
that sometime; but I reckon that just now, as my
pipe is out, I'm going to bed. I've not much hard
work to do on this round-up, and McIntyre isn't going
to put me on night herd, but I reckon I need all
the sleep I can get to-night."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br /><br />

<small><small>RIDING CIRCLE</small></small></h2>


<p>By the end of the following day the cutting of the
cattle&mdash;that is the work of separating the different
brands into the four bunches, or herds&mdash;had pretty
well been completed. McIntyre, therefore, determined
to send off to their home ranges, which were not far
away, the cattle bearing the Sturgis and Powell brands,
while the rest of the outfit would keep on and work
the remaining territory. It would take only three
or four days for the cattle that were now being sent
off to reach their home ranges, where they could be
turned loose, and probably held by one man with only
a little watching. As soon as the cattle had reached
their ranges and been turned over to the people at
the ranch, the men who had been sent back with those
brands would at once return to the camp and continue
the round-up work. Powell and his hired man
were to take the Powell cattle, while Hugh and Rube
were chosen to take back the Sturgis cattle. McIntyre
very wisely kept with him the younger men,
like Charley Powell and Jack, well understanding that
they would work harder and longer and would be
fresher every day than the older men.</p>

<p>The cattle started at daylight the next morning,
and Jack rode a few miles with the Sturgis cattle,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>which were going directly across country, and not
around by way of Powell's ranch.</p>

<p>The cows moved very deliberately and were constantly
stopping to feed; and by the time Jack had
ridden four or five miles back and forth behind the
herd, pushing on the lagging ones and breathing the
dust kicked up by the feet of the cattle, he was glad
that the task of driving the bunch back to the ranch
had fallen to others.</p>

<p>Finally he turned about, to go back to the round-up
camp.</p>

<p>"I reckon you'll see us again in about four days,"
Hugh said. "It'll take us pretty nearly three days
to get to the ranch with these cows, and a day to
get back to camp. We'll strike it down close to the
Platte, likely on Sand Creek. I don't suppose you
have any message for your uncle?"</p>

<p>"Just tell him I am all right and having a good
time. You might tell him, too, what happened over
at Powell's. And, of course, if there's any mail for
me, bring it back with you. I don't expect to hear
anything from that man I bought the saddle from.
Maybe, instead of leaving the saddle at Brown's, he
just took it with him on the train; but if he did, I
wouldn't be a bit surprised if he sent me back my five
dollars."</p>

<p>"Well," said Hugh, "it will be all guessing for a
while yet; but I'll bring any mail there is."</p>

<p>"So long," called Rube; and Jack turned and rode
back toward the camp. The distance that had seemed
so very long when driving the herd, now seemed surprisingly
short, for he rode fast. He did not ride
back to the old camp because they were going to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>move that morning, and when he rode down out of
the hills he could see, a couple of miles away on the
prairie, the two wagons and the cávaya crawling along
over the sage-brush flat toward the next camp, which
was to be on Box Elder Creek.</p>

<p>When he overtook the wagons, Frank, the cook,
who was driving the chuck wagon, told him that McIntyre
had left word that Jack should start out and
make a short circle to the eastward, taking in the low
hills on the edge of the basin, but not going far back,
and should turn anything that he found down into
the flat country, where it could be readily gathered
the next day. Jack accordingly rode on to the cávaya,
roped a fresh horse, and turned loose Pawnee, and
then rode back to the cook's wagon, where he begged
from Frank a chunk of bread and some bacon. Having
disposed of that, he rode off toward the low hills
to the east.</p>

<p>When he had gone a short distance into the hills
he saw fresh tracks of horses and of cattle running,
and from this he concluded that riders had passed over
this ground the day before and gathered what cattle
had been feeding there; and presently, coming across
a trail of a good many head, with horse tracks following
the trail and on top of the cow tracks, he made
sure that his conclusion was right.</p>

<p>After riding a mile or two farther, however, he
came across a little bunch of cattle feeding on the
steep hillsides of a ravine, and going around them he
pushed them down the hill and in the direction in
which he was riding. The cattle were not wild, and
it would have been easy to drive them in any direction;
but of course they went slowly, and if Jack
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>simply drove them into the round-up camp he could
not cover much country; on the other hand, if he
drove them down into the valley he knew that at this
time of the day they would at once turn about and
return to the hills where there was water and, in the
ravines, the green grass that the cattle like.</p>

<p>While he was mulling over this, and wondering
what he would better do, the cattle ahead of him
passed over a ridge and down the steep sides of another
ravine, and two or three yearlings in play ran
down the hill and through a thick patch of low brush
that grew at the bottom of the ravine. As they rushed
into that, from its upper end a small black animal,
which was unmistakably a bear cub, ran out.</p>

<p>Jack was riding a good quick horse, and almost
without thinking he turned and galloped along the
steep hillside to try to head off the cub, which kept
on up the bottom of the ravine. The ground was
very steep, and broken every now and then by little
washouts, and two or three times Jack held his
breath as he wondered whether the horse would get
across them or not. But the animal was sure-footed,
besides being swift. It did not even stumble; and
before long Jack was bearing down well toward the
bottom of the ravine and was a little ahead of the
bear. When the two were pretty close together,
the bear suddenly turned and began to scramble up the
hill, away from Jack. Two or three jumps of the
active horse, however, quickly brought it within roping
distance, and in a moment the noose was over
the bear's head. The horse had turned, and with a
mighty pluck the little bear flew out from the hillside
and seemed to land on its head in the middle of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>the ravine. Jack kept the rope tight for a moment,
but seeing that there was no movement at the other
end, he dismounted and walked back to the bear.
The little beast&mdash;hardly larger than a setter dog&mdash;was
quite dead. Jack could not tell whether the
pull of the rope had broken its neck, or it had been
killed by its fall.</p>

<p>The work of dressing the cub took but a few moments;
but to get it on the saddle was more difficult,
for the horse regarded the carcass with suspicion
and declined to stand when the bear was put on it.
Jack was finally obliged to blind the animal with his
coat until the load was firmly tied behind the saddle.
Then&mdash;being unwilling to take risks in this rough
country&mdash;he led the animal down the ravine. It
did not pitch, though it shied and several times tried
to rid itself of the saddle by prolonged kicking. At
length, however, when Jack reached a place where
the ravine was wider and the ground more or less level,
he mounted, and the horse went well enough.</p>

<p>Then Jack went back to look for his cattle. He
soon found them, and after following them over three
or four ridges, came on another much larger group.
Gathering them all together, he started down toward
the prairie with about seventy-five head of cattle before
him. He took good note of the point where he
left the hills, intending to drive his cattle into camp
and then, if daylight lasted, to come back and resume
his search for others.</p>

<p>He pushed the cattle pretty hard, and about the
middle of the afternoon had brought them within a
mile of camp, where he left them and, getting a fresh
horse, returned to the hills.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>
<p>During the afternoon he found two or three more
little bunches of cattle, and shortly before sundown
started in with about thirty head. As he was riding
toward camp, he met the bunch that he had driven
in that afternoon working back toward the hills; so
he finally brought in and delivered at camp about
one hundred head.</p>

<p>The other parties that had been riding circle during
the day had gathered a good many cattle; so
that there was again a good-sized herd being held near
the camp, to be taken on the next day and to be added
to daily, until enough had been gathered for another
cutting.</p>

<p>Jack's roping of the little bear was interesting to
the camp chiefly because of the variety that it would
give to the daily fare of beef and bacon; but another
one of the cowboys had had an adventure that had
not turned out so comfortably as Jack's.</p>

<p>Juan, a Mexican, who had drifted into the country
from the southwest, and who was a most skilful
cow hand, in riding along a steep mountain-side, rough
with rocks, had startled from his bed beneath an old
cedar tree a big bull elk with thick, growing horns
just beginning to branch. Juan, of course, rode after
him as hard as he could go. The roughness of the
ground and the great rocks that lay everywhere scattered
along the mountain-side offered no impediment
to the elk's speed, but the horse could not do its best
on this ground, and had difficulty in overtaking the
elk. At length a little patch of smoother ground
was reached. Juan pushed his horse up within throwing
distance and made a good throw which settled
around the animal's head and neck. The loop was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>so large, however, that it fell down against the brute's
chest; and just at that moment pursued and pursuer
came to a piece of ground so rough with great rocks
that even Juan did not dare to ride into it. He tried to
stop and throw the elk; but there was not time for
him to turn; and the steady pull of the elk's chest
on the rope dragged the horse staggering onward for
a few feet, when Juan, to save his mount, was obliged
to free his rope from the horn of the saddle. The
elk sailed up the mountain-side, the rope dragging
behind it, while Juan sat there on his panting horse
and uttered Mexican maledictions. That evening the
cowboys had a good deal of fun with Juan.</p>

<p>After supper, Jack saw Tulare Joe sitting on the
ground working at something a little way from the
camp, and walking over to him saw that he was taking
off bits of flesh from a small deer hide which
was entirely fresh.</p>

<p>"Where did you get your hide, Joe?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>"Why," said Joe, "some of the boys started the
deer to-day out of a little patch of brush. It ran
from them up over the hill and met me just on top.
I happened to have my rope in my hand and I caught
it. I'm going to keep it and get two or three others,
if I can, and make me a buckskin shirt for winter.
They say they're the warmest things you can wear
when you're riding in a cold wind, and they don't
muffle you up the way a coat does&mdash;they leave you
free. I'd like to stretch this hide, if I could; but I
won't have time to do it on the round-up. If I could
stretch it and get it dried flat it would make it easier
to pack and easier to handle when it comes to tanning
it; but of course on the round-up I haven't the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>time to peg the hide out, and no time to do the tanning
while it's fresh, the way it really ought to be
done."</p>

<p>"I didn't know," said Jack, "that it's better to
tan a hide right fresh than after it is dried."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Joe, "it is; at least, that's what I've
been told. All I know about tanning was taught me
by the Navajos down south, and they make awful
good soft buckskin."</p>

<p>"I have never done any tanning; but I have seen
a heap of robes dressed by women in the Blackfeet
country. They tan a buffalo robe in a wonderful way,
so that it is as soft as a piece of cloth; but they don't
make good buckskin. According to all I have heard,
the mountain Indians make the best buckskin."</p>

<p>"That's what they say," answered Joe. "I've
seen some wonderful buckskin made by the Utes, and
by the Navajos too."</p>

<p>"You have been down among the Navajos, have
you?" Jack asked, as he sat down on the ground
and, taking out his pocket-knife, began to work on
the skin. "I'm interested in them, for when I was
a little fellow I used to read Mayne Reid's books,
and they had lots to say about the Navajos, and about
the raids they used to make down in Mexico."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Joe, "they were certainly great raiders;
and they've got lots of men and women and children
there in the camp that are as white as I am.
Most of them, they say, were captured down in Mexico
as little children and brought up and raised in the
tribe, and now, so far as their feelings go, are just
as pure Navajo as anybody could be."</p>

<p>"I guess that's so. There isn't anything in blood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>or race that makes a white man different from an
Indian, if he is brought up in an Indian way."</p>

<p>"Not much. Those Navajos, too, are mighty
handy with tools and with their fingers. I reckon
you've seen lots of Navajo blankets, and likely, too,
you may have seen some of the silversmith work
they do. They make fine rings and sort of pins,
like the women wear at their throats, and they're
pretty handy about setting bits of turquoise in silver.
They make a whole lot of real pretty ornaments."</p>

<p>"I've heard something about that," said Jack;
"though I've never seen any of their work, except
maybe a blanket or two. And you say they're tanners,
too?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I had a kind of friend in the camp once
when I stayed down there, and he showed me his
way of tanning; and he certainly did make nice buckskin."</p>

<p>"I wish you would tell me how to do it; or, better
still, let me see you tan this hide," said Jack. "But
the first thing you want to do with this hide is to
try to stretch it flat, and that you can't do in the common
way. Why don't you treat it the way the trappers
treat beaver skins?"</p>

<p>"Well, if I knew how, maybe I would; but I don't
know how. I never saw anybody trap beaver."</p>

<p>"Why," exclaimed Jack, "I can show you how in
a minute and a half if we can get some willows that
will bend right, and I'm pretty sure we can, for
there's a bunch down there close to the creek. Come
on down with me and we'll cut some shoots; and then
if you've got a piece of twine we'll stretch the hide
on a hoop. Very likely it will be set by morning,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>and you can get Frank to carry it inside his chuck
wagon tied to the bows."</p>

<p>"I'll go with you," said Joe, "if you'll just show
me what to do."</p>

<p>Along the border of the stream was a growth of
rather tall willows two or three years old, and Jack
soon cut half a dozen long and rather slender shoots.
Then the boys returned to the place where the deer
hide had been left. Here Jack trimmed the willow
shoots in the proper way, leaving many twigs at the
smaller ends, and, showing Joe how to do it, they
soon made an oblong hoop somewhat longer and wider
than the fresh deer hide stretched out on the ground.</p>

<p>"Now," explained Jack, "if you've got a piece
of twine we'll sew the edges of this hide just inside
the hoop, stretching the hide all we can, and the hoop
will keep it perfectly flat and stretched till it's dry."</p>

<p>"That's a new one on me," declared Joe. "I
never knew any way of stretching a deer hide except
to peg it out flat on the ground, or maybe to
nail it on the side of a barn. That's mighty cute,
though, the way you made the hoop by just tying
the slender willow twigs around the main piece of
wood. It seems firm, too, as if it were going to
hold."</p>

<p>"Oh, it will hold all right; and it will do the work
it's intended to do. You see there isn't much strain
coming on any particular part of the hoop. It's evenly
distributed all around, and it gives a straight outward
pull to the hide. That's the way we always
used to dry our beaver skins; but of course they are
pretty nearly round, so that we made those hoops in
the shape of a circle."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>
<p>Joe went over to his bed and from his war-sack
fished out a piece of twine; and before long the deer
hide was nicely stretched on the hoop, carried over
to the cook wagon, and put in charge of Frank, and,
for safety's sake, tied to the bows at the top of the
wagon.</p>

<p>"Well," said Joe, as they walked over to the fire,
"I'm mightily obliged to you for that. If you want
me to, I'd like to show you how to tan a deer hide
Navajo fashion. Maybe I'll get a chance to do that
before the round-up is over&mdash;that is, if you'd like
to know how."</p>

<p>"I sure would, Joe," answered Jack. "I don't
know anything about tanning myself, though I have
seen a whole lot of hides dressed. It would be pretty
nice to be able to make good buckskin."</p>

<p>About the fire almost the whole camp was gathered,
the men smoking their last pipes or cigarettes, before
turning in, while those who were soon to go
out on night herd had already brought up their
horses, which were standing saddled not far from the
fire. As Jack and Tulare Joe strolled up, McIntyre
called to them:</p>

<p>"You two kids had better get your horses now,
and be ready to go out on the last relief. Do you
think you can wake up at two o'clock, Jack?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe I can, Mr. McIntyre," Jack replied.
"I'll have to get one of the boys to come in
and call me."</p>

<p>"Well," said McIntyre, "if you're going to get up
at that time, you'd better turn in quick, or else you'll
be short of sleep."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br /><br />

<small><small>A BULL FIGHT</small></small></h2>


<p>Jack was slow to respond to the call the next morning,
but after a minute or two he reluctantly rolled
out of bed, and putting on his shoes&mdash;and his coat,
for the morning seemed cold&mdash;he rolled up and roped
his bed. When he reached his horse he could hear
Joe not far off drawing the latigo of his saddle and
whistling softly to himself, and in a few minutes the
two were riding off toward the cattle. The night
was black and the stars sparkled in the clear air, but
off to the eastern horizon the light grew constantly
stronger as they rode along.</p>

<p>"That can't be day coming, is it, Joe?" Jack remarked.
"It seemed to me that I got up as soon as
I was called, and if I did it won't be getting light
for an hour yet."</p>

<p>"No," said Joe, "that's a little bit of the old moon
left, and we'll see it before long."</p>

<p>And just before they reached the herd, the small
moon, now a crescent, showed itself over the hill
in the east, and for a moment the trees that crowned
the hill were outlined sharply against the light.</p>

<p>The boys whom Jack and Joe were relieving said
that the cattle had been quiet ever since they came
on. The animals were tired from the drive that they
had had during the day, and the night was clear,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>calm and still, so there was no reason for their being
uneasy. Now followed a couple of hours of
monotonous riding around the herd, while one boy
or the other droned out a song, and occasionally spoke
as they passed. Presently the east showed gray, and
then yellow, changing to orange; and at length the
sun, with a bound, as it seemed, cleared the hilltop
that hid it and began its journey across the sky. By
this time the cattle had risen to their feet and were
beginning to feed, and the herders, instead of trying
to keep them in a bunch, rode out on either side, merely
to prevent their straying too far.</p>

<p>At length the boys who were to relieve them came
out, and Jack and Joe raced their horses back to camp,
caught up fresh horses, unsaddled those that they
had been using, and presently sat down to breakfast.
All the outfit had started to work, and Frank had
his wagon packed, ready to roll as soon as these last
two had finished breakfast.</p>

<p>"McIntyre told me to tell you," he said, "that you
two had better go along and help move the herd to
the next camp. That's what you get for going on
night herd&mdash;an easy job for the rest of the day."</p>

<p>"That suits me well enough," laughed Joe. "We'll
take it easy to-day, Jack, and I'll bet McIntyre will
make it up to us in the next few days, and we'll have
plenty of riding to do."</p>

<p>"I hope we will," replied Jack.</p>

<p>When they returned to the herd they found that
the cattle had about finished feeding, and had been
driven down to a little stream to drink. Now came
the work of pushing them along over the ten or twelve
miles to the next camp. It was a slow and more or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>less wearisome task; but, as Joe said, it was all in
the day's work. The cattle were full and lazy and
unwilling to move. Each one would go on just as
long as it was being driven, but all the others stopped.
It was constantly necessary to ride up behind the little
groups and urge them on, and the time of two
men was spent in riding backward and forward at
the tail of the herd pushing on the laggards. One
man rode ahead of the herd, at a slow walk; and
there was one at either side, to keep the cattle from
scattering.</p>

<p>After the herd had been moving along for two or
three hours, Bill Duncan, the man in the lead, called
back something to the others; but they did not hear
what he said, and, as he went on, paid no particular
attention to it. A few moments later there was quite
an excitement among the leading cattle. They were
lowing and clustering together in a thick bunch, and
as the cow punchers pushed up toward them they
could see that they were pawing the ground and some
of them were kneeling and thrusting their horns into
the soil, and there was much commotion. Quietly,
but very steadily the boys urged the cattle along and
at length broke up the gathering; but the animals were
excited, and the yearlings and young stock ran ahead,
kicking their heels in the air and striking at each other
with their horns.</p>

<p>After they had passed the place, the explanation of
the excitement was seen. Some animal had recently
been killed there, and its blood and other remains
smelled by the cattle had greatly excited them.</p>

<p>"That must have been what Bill was talking about
when he called back to us," Joe said to the others.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>"We ought to have sent some one up to find out
what he was saying."</p>

<p>"That's so," agreed Jack; "but, say, Joe, you know
more about cattle than I do, what is it that makes
stock stampede? Of course, it's easy enough to see
why they might get frightened at the smell of blood,
but I understand that sometimes they start off without
any reason whatever&mdash;any reason we can see, at
least."</p>

<p>"Well," Joe answered slowly, "you'll have to ask
somebody who knows more than I do. I've seen
cattle start off without any cause at all that I could
see, and they 'most always start off without any reason.
On a stormy night I've seen them stampede at
a flash of lightning, and then again, one still night
I saw a bunch start when one of the boys lighted
a match for his cigarette. One fall I was helping
drive a bunch of beef to the railroad; they went down
into a little valley and when they got close to the
stream a big flock of blackbirds flew up in a thick
cloud, making, of course, some noise with their wings,
and them fat beef just turned and ran for half a day.
Some of the cattle we never did find, and those that
we got I guess had lost fifty pounds to the head."</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Jack, "that it is just panic, and,
of course, in a panic nothing ever stops to reason."</p>

<p>"I guess that's about the size of it. I've read in
the papers stories about people getting scared and
stampeding, just exactly the way cattle or horses do,
and I reckon that all animals are a good deal alike
in this, whether they go on two legs or on four."</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said Jack; "some of the stories I've
read told about people getting scared in a theater
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>when it took fire, and they all seemed to lose their
senses, and sometimes the firemen would find the bodies
all piled up in a corner or against the wall, the under
ones dead from suffocation, just the way scared
sheep will pile up sometimes in the corner of the
shed, when you are catching them to dip them. The
men are just as bad as the women and children, and
seem to try to fight with them, trying to get out first."</p>

<p>"Down South I once saw a bunch of mules stampede.
They didn't seem to have any idea where they
were going, and a part of the bunch ran right slam
into a freight-car, and, of course, killed themselves."</p>

<p>"Well, it surely is not easy to explain these things,"
declared Jack. "I would like mighty well to have
some of these professors who are always studying
about the way the mind works tell me how the mind
of a horse or a cow acts when it is stampeding."</p>

<p>Joe laughed.</p>

<p>"Hold on there," he said. "You want to get
straight on that, I reckon. I never heard, and I don't
believe anybody else ever did, of a horse or a cow
stampeding. To have a stampede you've got to have
a lot of animals together, and they act on each other
and make each other more and more scared all the
time. You can frighten a single horse, or a single
cow, and it will run away, but it won't run far; but
you stampede a bunch of stock and it will run and
run and keep on running, and for a while it keeps
running harder and harder, all the time."</p>

<p>"I see what you mean; and I guess you're right
about it," conceded Jack.</p>

<p>One of the other boys had come up while they
were talking.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes," he said, "Joe has got it straight, all right;
and I never have been able to find out anything more
about it than he has. I've heard old cow men talk
about it, too, but I've never heard one of them say
that he could understand it. Joe's telling about seeing
a bunch of stock start when a boy lit a match,
reminds me of a time when I saw a bunch run just
because a fellow threw down his cigarette. If a
bunch of cattle is ready to run, it seems as if 'most
anything would start 'em. You talk to any old cow
man about this and you'll get a whole lot of facts,
but mighty few reasons."</p>

<p>All day long the cattle moved on over the rolling
hills. Often the wagons and <i>cávaya</i> could be seen at no
very great distance; and at last, late in the afternoon,
the camp was sighted and the boys took the stock
down below it on the creek, let them drink, and then
feed slowly back into the hills. They were kept pretty
well together all the time, but would not, of course,
be bedded down until near sunset. Jack and Joe
stopped here with the herd, while the other boys went
into camp to get their supper. They would then
come out again to bed down the cattle, and be relieved
a little later by the regular night herders. The
cattle were hungry, and were feeding greedily. They
needed little or no looking after; and the boys, riding
to the top of a hill, got off their horses and, throwing
down their reins and holding the ends of their
ropes, let the saddle horses feed about them. As they
sat there talking about various things, Joe happened
to speak of southern California, and the way the Mexicans
rode and handled cattle, and as they talked he
told Jack something of his past life.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>
<p>"My father," he said, "came out with one of the
early emigrant trains with his brothers and sisters, his
father and mother having a nice little outfit of their
own. Somehow or other, when they were crossing
through the mountains in the late fall, just before
reaching California, they got separated from the main
train, and got off in a little pocket by themselves, and
didn't seem to be able to find their way out of it.
I never rightly understood how it was, for my father
died when I was a little fellow, but it seems that
they got up there and the snow was so deep that they
could not get out. Their stock was getting poor and
they didn't have enough provisions to last them
through the winter. I've heard my grandmother tell
how grandfather worried about what he ought to do,
and how at last he made up his mind that he had to
go down to the main trail and get help, or else they
would all starve to death. He made himself a pair of
snowshoes, left his rifle with his wife, took one day's
grub, and started to try to find the trail. My grandmother
didn't want him to go a bit; she was afraid
that he would get lost, and then they'd be worse off
than ever. If they had to die, she wanted all of
them to die together.</p>

<p>"He started off and did get lost, but, somehow
or other, he managed to get down near to the trail,
and was found by a man who was hunting deer for
a little train that was coming along. That train was
all right. It went into camp and the men started out
and broke a way up into the little valley where my
grandmother was, and brought down the whole outfit
and took them on to California. There my grandfather
got work and did pretty well, and when my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>father grew up he went down near Los Angeles, and
took up a ranch there, and we have always been comfortably
off. But I always wanted to ride a horse
rather than go to school, and as soon as I was big
enough I got work with one of the cattle companies
down there, and I've been punching cows ever since.
Of course I was a big fool not to go to school and
get a good education instead of just being able to
read and write, as I am now; but I've seen a lot of
work with cows, and, I tell you, some of those greasers
down there can stay with a horse and handle a rope
better than any man you ever see in this country."</p>

<p>"I expect they're mighty fine riders, Joe; and in
the old times, when there were cattle all over the
country there, 'most all the men must have been great
cow hands, just as I suppose they are now in Mexico.
Every fellow was put on a horse as soon as he was
able to toddle, and I suppose he stayed with it until
he was an old man."</p>

<p>"Yes, if he didn't get killed before he grew old.
Hold on, Jack! Watch those bulls down there!" Joe
exclaimed. "I think we're going to have a scrap!"</p>

<p>For some time Jack had heard low rumblings coming
from the bunch of cattle but had paid no attention
to them; but now he saw that a couple of big bulls
seemed to be making preparations for a fight. One
of them was a white-faced red and white animal which
might be a grade Durham or Hereford, while the
other, solid red in color, looked more like one of the
old-fashioned long-horned Texans, or at least what
they used to call out in that country a Cherokee.</p>

<p>Fifteen years earlier, as Jack had often been told,
almost all the cattle in the country were Texas cattle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>driven up from the south to the plains, and there
purchased by the northern cattlemen, taken out to
their ranches, fed for a year or two, and then shipped
to market. The excellent grazing and the cold
winters seemed to make these cattle grow larger and
fatter than the Texas cattle were, and they brought
good prices in Chicago. Moreover, the calves raised
on the northern range were bigger and better than
those brought up from the south, and it was not long
before the northern cattle owners got into the way
of buying herds of Texas cows and grading them
up with more or less well-bred bulls. This course
made a very great change in the cattle. They grew
larger in body, shorter in limb, lost their long horns
and became far more like real beef steers than the
old Texas long-horns ever were. It was now getting
to be almost unusual to see an animal that looked
like a Texas long-horn, or even like a Cherokee steer.</p>

<p>One of these bulls, however, was of the old type,
while the other seemed to represent the new. The
two stood facing each other, not very far apart, muttering,
moaning, pawing up the dust and throwing it
high in the air to fall on their broad backs and roll
back to the ground. Presently the short-horned bull
went down on his knees and thrust his horns into
the earth, and then rose and shook the dirt from his
head. The other bull did the same thing, his long
horns tearing up a great mass of soil, and when he
rose to his feet his shaggy face and head were covered
with dirt and sticks picked up from the ground.
Slowly the bulls drew nearer to each other, and at
length, when but a few feet apart, the red bull sprang
forward; the other bent down and lunged to meet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>him, and their horns came together with a sharp
clash. The shock affected neither bull; neither gave
back; and for some moments they pushed and pushed
against each other, their feet plowing up the soil and
the tense corded muscles standing out like ridges on
their great hams.</p>

<p>The remainder of the herd had drawn off a little
to one side. Most of the animals were still feeding
or looking off over the prairie, heeding the battle
not at all, but a little fringe of cows and young stock
on the edge of the herd faced the fighting bulls and
looked at them with mild interest.</p>

<p>Jack and Joe watched the fight eagerly.</p>

<p>"The chances are all in favor of the big bull," declared
Joe. "He's got the weight and he'll win out."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Jack. "It looks to me as
if he were going to push the red bull all over the
prairie; but, on the other hand, the little one is twice
as quick and twice as active. What's more, I'll bet
the red fellow has twice the wind of the other, and
if he can tire out that big fat bull he'll make him
run."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Joe, "there's no doubt that if he's
got the wit to work the fight right, he'll be able to
drive the big bull; but if the big bull is smart, he
won't let himself be tired out."</p>

<p>"Well, let's see. Look at the way the big fellow
is pushing back the little fellow now!"</p>

<p>And certainly it seemed as if weight were beginning
to tell, for, little by little, the red bull moved
backward, and appeared to be quite unable to hold his
opponent. In the meantime, the horns of both bulls
began to show red as if smeared with blood.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>
<p>Farther and farther the red bull was pushed back.
Presently he stopped resisting; by a nimble bound he
sprang off to one side and, quickly circling, returned
to the attack, as if trying to gore the big bull in the
neck or shoulders. The big one had turned, however,
and received the shock on his horns; and this
time without much delay he pushed his enemy back.
The red bull again jumped and again made a circle,
and the big bull, seeing what was intended, faced to
receive the charge on his horns. The two came together
hard, and the sound of the shock was plainly
heard. By this time both were weary and winded,
and their long tongues hung out of their mouths and
almost reached to the ground.</p>

<p>It seemed now as if the red bull were trying to do
precisely what Jack had spoken of a little while before&mdash;to
tire out his stronger opponent&mdash;and it
soon began to look as if he were succeeding. The big
bull turned more slowly to receive the charge; and,
while he had not as yet received any noticeable wound,
he looked as if he would like to stop fighting, and
to call the battle a draw. He began to look from one
side to the other, and at last it was evident that he
was trying to get away.</p>

<p>"By gosh! the little fellow has got him whipped!"
Joe cried.</p>

<p>A moment or two later the big bull, when he had
the opportunity, turned tail and trotted heavily off
over the prairie away from the herd. The little one
followed him, of course, and butted him in the hips
with great force but his wide-spread horns did not
cut the flesh. Each time the red bull hit his opponent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>the big bull roared with fear, and the sight greatly amused
the cowboys.</p>

<p>"Come on," Joe said at last; "we mustn't let those
fellows go too far. They've got to be brought back
to the bunch."</p>

<p>Jumping on their horses they followed the two,
first turning the red bull, which was loath to leave the
pursuit. Joe hurried him back to the herd, while Jack
rode on a little way, turned the big bull, and slowly
drove him to the bunch.</p>

<p>Soon after this, and long before they had finished
talking over the fight, the other men came back from
camp, and Joe and Jack went in to get their supper.</p>

<small><small>A BUFFALO STORY</small></small></h2>


<p>Two days later Jack, pretty tired and riding a tired
horse, came into camp after a long day, and was delighted
to see Hugh standing by the cook fire, as usual
smoking his pipe. Jack shouted a greeting and Hugh
waved his pipe in salutation, and a moment later when
the saddle had been thrown on the ground, and the
tired horse was rolling, the two shook hands.</p>

<p>"Well," exclaimed Jack, "what's the news? Did
anything happen to you on your way back with the
cattle?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Hugh; "we just pushed 'em along
as fast as we comfortably could, brought 'em to camp
late at night, pretty tired, and didn't bother to bed
'em down or watch 'em. They got in hungry, and as
soon as they had eaten a plenty they lay down and
stayed down all night. When we got within five or
six miles of the ranch I sent Rube in ahead and pushed
the cattle on myself, and before very long your Uncle
and Joe came out and we drove the herd down below
the little lake and turned 'em loose there. That
was yesterday afternoon pretty early. Rube and I
went up to the bunk-house and gossiped a while with
Mr. Sturgis, and then after we had had something to
eat, we turned around and rode until dark and then
camped, and came on here to-day."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>
<p>"That was a good quiet trip," said Jack. "I am
glad that nothing bad happened. There was no reason
why anything should happen, for these cattle are
almost on their own range; and they shouldn't be
wild or uneasy. What's the news back at the ranch,
Hugh? Did Uncle Will, or Joe, have anything special
to talk about?"</p>

<p>"Not a thing," was the reply. "It's just as quiet
there as can be. Joe's 'tending to his stock, what
little of it there is there, and Mr. Sturgis, I reckon,
just reads and writes. By the way, though, he did
tell me that he went up on the mountains back of the
house the other day and killed a yearling for meat.
He said there were lots of elk there&mdash;big bunches of
cows and calves. When I told him I was coming right
back here, he sat down and wrote to you and asked
me to take the letter along with two or three others
that had come for you. You see, he sent Joe into the
railroad for mail only two or three days ago."</p>

<p>Jack took the letters, and presently went off to read
them. Two were from his father and mother, in
New York, and one from his uncle. By the time he
had finished reading them, supper was ready and the
boys were crowding around the fire, filling their plates
and cups.</p>

<p>After supper, Hugh, Joe and Jack were sitting together
near the cook fire, Hugh smoking and the boys
slapping viciously at the mosquitoes, which were pretty
bad.</p>

<p>"I saw one thing to-day, son," said Hugh, "that
interested me a little, and that was a buffalo carcass."</p>

<p>"Why, Hugh," exclaimed Jack, "I didn't know
there were any buffalo about here. Of course, I've
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>heard that there is a little bunch up in the Rattlesnake
Mountains, but I've never seen any sign down
this way."</p>

<p>"No," returned Hugh; "I don't guess there are
any buffalo around here. The carcass to-day is the
first I've seen for six or seven years. I remember
about the time you first came out to the ranch we ran
across a buffalo that had been killed not very long before.
I figured that it had wandered out from the
Rattlesnake Mountains and crossed the Platte, but I
never knew what had killed it. I don't know what
killed this one that I found to-day. It was killed this
spring sometime, but had been dead too long for me
to find out much about it. I wouldn't be surprised if
there were a very few buffalo up in the Rattlesnake
hills; and every now and then, if one comes out and
goes down to the Platte River, somebody takes a shot
or two at it, and it gets killed. I haven't heard of
anybody killing a buffalo around here for a good
many years.</p>

<p>"I reckon I've told you, son, about what Uncle
Jack Robinson used to say about buffalo on the Laramie
Plains, and in this high country, away back long
before I came out here, and in fact I guess when Uncle
Jack was quite a young man&mdash;anyway, not more than
a middle-aged man. He said that in his young days,
when he first came into the country, the Laramie
Plains and all this high country was full of buffalo,
but that one winter there came a terrible snowstorm
without any wind, and the snow lay four or five feet
deep on the ground. After this snow came a change
of weather, either a big thaw or a warm rain, and
then a freeze, and the whole country was crusted over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>so that none of the animals could get down to the
grass to feed. That winter, Uncle Jack said, killed
just about everything in the country and, among the
other things, the buffalo. He said that since that
time there never had been any buffalo on the Laramie
Plains, or in this high country. I always figured
from what he told me that this big storm must have
come in the winter of 1839-40. Uncle Jack said
that for years after that it was hard to find any game
up in this country, but, of course, as time went on
the deer and the elk and the antelope got plentiful
again, but the buffalo never came back."</p>

<p>"I suppose the fact is, Hugh," said Jack, "that by
that time the people on the plains were killing them
so that they had no chance to work back into the
mountains."</p>

<p>"Likely that was so," assented Hugh.</p>

<p>"There's another thing about buffalo I want to ask
you," said Jack; "though I think you've told me
about it before. Some of the old books talk, as I
remember it, about buffalo spending the summer up
in the north, and then migrating south in the fall,
spending the winter down in Texas or Mexico, and
then going back again when spring came. I'm pretty
sure you told me once that there was never anything
like this."</p>

<p>"No," answered Hugh, "there never was; and if
you'll think about it a little bit you'll see there couldn't
be. It's a long way from the Canada line down to
Mexico, and just as far back again. If the buffalo
made journeys like that spring and fall, they'd never
have time to do anything else, and they sure would
never be fat. Of course buffalo shifted their ranges
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>more or less, spring and fall. They'd move up into
the high country on the flanks of the mountains, and
often up mountain valleys in summer, and then in
fall they'd drift east on to the prairie and get into
breaks or broken country of one kind and another,
and stop there. Sometimes they'd make quite long
journeys and it would be hard for the Indians to find
them, but they never started off to travel a thousand
miles or so to avoid cold weather, and then turned
round and came back to avoid hot weather.</p>

<p>"The buffalo didn't mind the cold very much; on
the other hand, they like shelter in the worst weather.
I've seen places on the flanks of the mountains in
the broken country where the buffalo wintered&mdash;places
they used to go to for shelter in the worst
storms&mdash;where you would find the dung four or
five feet deep. I remember one such place in a little
side ravine running into a draw that goes down into
the Rosebud, where I took the trouble to dig down
into the dry dung, and I made a hole half as deep as
I am tall, and didn't get to the bottom then. This
was a sheltered place under thick pine trees, and all
the signs showed that the buffalo used to gather there
to get out of the wind and snow, and stand there
pretty nearly as warm as they would be in a barn.
Right within half a mile there was the best kind of
feed."</p>

<p>"Don't you remember, Hugh," interrupted Jack,
"that year we went up to the head of the St. Mary's
River, how you showed me the place where the sheep
used to come down and stand in winter?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Hugh. "That's another sort of an
animal, but it shows what I've said to you before, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>all animals, except those that are hunting other animals,
are very likely to live in a small range of country,
and not to get away from it except at some change
of the seasons, or when they are driven away. It's
just the same with range stock&mdash;cows or horses.
You ask Joe here, and I reckon he'll tell you the same
thing."</p>

<p>"That's so," asserted Joe. "Everybody knows
that a few horses will stop in a particular place and
live there all through the summer, or all through the
winter; they always drink at the same stream; they
always feed about the same place; they go up on the
same high point to stand and look. It's something
like that, too, with the cattle; and I reckon it's that
way with all animals."</p>

<p>"That's what I believe," said Hugh; "and I can
tell you a story about something that I saw once, and
that plenty of other people saw too, that seems to
me to prove it.</p>

<p>"In the fall of 1866 I was working for the government,
sort of half scout and half general handy man,
and went with Lieutenant Stouch&mdash;a mighty fine
officer he was&mdash;down into Kansas to build up old
Fort Fletcher, which was on the north fork of Big
Creek, and about sixteen miles below Fort Hayes.</p>

<p>"It was nice, bright, cool fall weather, and when
we got to the place that had been picked out for the
Fort, and went into camp, we saw quite a bunch of
buffalo feeding in the stream bottom, hardly more
than half a mile above us. Of course the country
then was full of buffalo, and this was one of their
great ranges. I suppose there must have been eight
or nine hundred in this bunch.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>
<p>"When Lieutenant Stouch saw this herd, he had
what always struck me as a mighty smart thought, and
a thought too that showed that he knew a whole lot
about animals, and about the plains country; and yet
he hadn't been out there very long, because the war
was only just over and he'd fought through the war.
It occurred to him not to meddle with these buffalo
and that just as long as they stopped where they were,
he could get fresh meat for his command with mighty
little trouble. So he gave orders to the soldiers not
to hunt up the creek, but to do their hunting downstream,
and especially not to do anything to frighten
these buffalo.</p>

<p>"He picked out a man and sent him to go up the
creek to kill a buffalo, but told him not to show himself
before he shot, nor after; just to kill the cow and
then stay there hid, until a wagon came up for the
meat. The man obeyed orders. When he fired, the
buffalo he had shot at ran a few steps, and then
stopped and lay down. Those nearest to it gave a
jump or two and looked around, but as they saw no
one they went on feeding.</p>

<p>"They were watching in camp, and when they saw
what had happened they sent out a wagon to bring
in the meat, and as it drove up slowly to the place,
the buffalo near it just walked out of the way. The
dead animal was butchered and loaded into the wagon
and brought back to camp.</p>

<p>"This happened every day. Nothing occurred to
scare the buffalo. They got used to seeing the people
at work on the buildings and got used to the
wagons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>"After a while, a couple more companies of soldiers
came to the post; one company of cavalry and
one of infantry. Lieutenant Stouch told the officers
what he had been doing, and asked them to follow out
the same plan. They did so, and the buffalo stopped
right there. This went on until well into the winter,
when one day in the morning Lieutenant Stouch sent
for me and told me that a sergeant who had just come
in from a scout had reported that he had met our
buffalo herd traveling up the creek about fifteen miles
distant. The Lieutenant told me he believed that
these buffalo could be brought back, and asked me
what I thought about it. I told him I didn't know,
but they ought to be mighty tame, and I believed that
they could just quietly be driven back.</p>

<p>"'Well, Johnson,' he said to me, 'I believe so too,
and we're going to try it.'</p>

<p>"He took about twenty-five soldiers, and three or
four of the officers went along, and we rode off up
the creek, and after a while passed the herd and went
down into the valley above it. There we scattered
out all the way across the bottom like skirmishers,
and commenced to walk slowly toward the buffalo.
When they first saw us they stood and looked for
quite a long time, and I thought it was mighty uncertain
whether they would drive or whether they
would run off over the bluffs, but after a little those
that were nearest to us turned around and began to
feed down the valley, working back the way they had
come, and before night we had the bunch back on
its old feeding ground just above the post, and when
it got there we rode out of the valley and round over
the hills to camp.</p>

<p>"That bunch of buffalo stayed there for two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>months longer, and for all I know they would have
been there yet, if it hadn't been that, along in April,
the Seventh Cavalry, under General Custer, came into
the post for supplies, and some of his command ran
into those buffalo and chased them to kill meat for
the command, and they scattered out and never came
back again.</p>

<p>"That bunch of buffalo stayed there in that one
place for about six months, not scared, although animals
enough were killed out of it to supply a hundred
and fifty officers and men with fresh meat during all
that time. I reckon there was an animal killed every
day or two; only they were killed in a sensible way and
the herd was never frightened."</p>

<p>"Well, well," said Joe; "that seems to me one of
the strangest things I ever heard of; and it just shows
how near buffalo are to being cattle. You can imagine
a thing of that kind happening to a bunch of cows,
but it's new to me that it could happen to buffalo."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," replied Hugh, "that it shows that
wild animals don't spend all their time wandering over
the country, as most people think they do, but each
set of animals has some little range of country that's
like home to them."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jack, "I guess that's the fact; and yet
I believe most people don't understand it at all. I've
heard my uncle say the same thing about wild animals,
and about some kinds of birds. I mean birds
like partridges and quail, that don't go south in winter,
the way most birds do."</p>

<p>"Well," exclaimed Hugh, "the fact is that most
people don't know anything at all about how wild
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>animals live, and of course they can't have right ideas
about 'em. But here I've taken a whole lot of sleeping
time talking to you boys about animals! We'd
better quit now and turn in."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br /><br />

<small><small>VICENTE, COW HAND</small></small></h2>


<p>It was plain daylight, but the sun had not risen, when
Vicente, Tulare Joe and Jack set out from the camp
to ride circle through the rough hills to the northeast.
They would gather whatever cattle they could
find and bring them to the camp, which would be
moved a short distance farther during the day.</p>

<p>Vicente was a Mexican, of at least middle age. His
hair and mustache were jet black, but his side-whiskers
were gray. With his stiff conical black hat and a little
military cape which he often wore, sitting erect
in his saddle, with an air of great dignity, he looked
more like a Spanish hidalgo than an everyday cowboy
of the plains. No one knew Vicente's history, nor
where he came from. This was not especially because
he was a silent man, for in fact he often talked
quite freely, but however much he talked, he himself
was never the subject of his conversation.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his dignity, his unusual clothing
and his more or less precise and elaborate manner,
Vicente was a wonderful cow hand. If anything
especially difficult had to be done, he was usually called
upon to do it. If some steers had to be handled in
a small corral, Vicente was likely to ride into the corral
on his favorite gray roping horse, and to pick
out one animal after another, throw and tie it, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>then when all hands on foot had gotten through with
it, and had bolted for the fence, Vicente would untie
the steer and dodge it until it wearied of the effort
to fight him and went back to crowd in among the
other animals.</p>

<p>The younger cowboys stood somewhat in awe of
Vicente, and never tried to play jokes on him, nor
made fun of him as they did of each other; though of
course they cheered and shouted if by chance he
mounted a horse which bucked with unusual ferocity.
No horse, however vicious, energetic or long-winded
had as yet been found, so far as any one on this
round-up knew, that was able to stir Vicente from
his saddle.</p>

<p>Hugh once said that only once in his life had he
seen a man who rode as well and as certainly as
Vicente. This was an old Mexican known as "One-Eyed
Juan" who used to live down at Bent's Old
Fort on the Arkansas. It was said that if a particularly
bad horse had to be ridden down there at
Bent's Fort&mdash;one that none of the Mexicans or Indians
could do anything with&mdash;Juan would mount
it, and putting a silver dollar between the sole of each
foot and the stirrup, would ride the beast to a standstill,
and when he dismounted the silver dollars were
always found in the stirrups. One who saw Vicente
ride a bad horse could believe this story. He rode
in quite a different way from the American cow
punchers, even those who were never thrown. Some
of them lopped about on the horse, riding on one
thigh or the other, and some seemed wholly unconcerned
as to what the horse did; but, while they rode
well, and were never shaken from their seats, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>did not ride gracefully, firmly and steadily as did
Vicente.</p>

<p>The three men rode fast to the edge of the hills,
and had little to say to each other, but when they
reached the point where they must separate to look
for the cattle, Joe and Jack, by common consent, turned
to the older man and asked him for instructions.
Vicente's English was extraordinary and, until one
was familiar with it, not easy to understand; but,
brokenly as he spoke, every one in this cow camp understood
him, as indeed did every one in all the region
round about, for he had lived here for a long time,
and on all the range was a well-known personage.</p>

<p>"How shall we work, Vicente?" asked Joe. "You
tell us and we'll try to do as you say."</p>

<p>"It looks to me best," Vicente answered, "that
Joe rides along the edge of the hills looking up the
valleys; and you, Jack, ride a mile or two back from
the edge; and I'll go still farther back toward the divide,
maybe up on the divide&mdash;anyhow, so as to see the
heads of all the coulées. What cattle Joe finds and
what cattle I find we'll drive along and turn down
to Jack, and Jack will push along the bunch, while we
try to get all the cows that are feeding in these ravines."</p>

<p>"We'll do that," said Joe; "and that means that
I turn off now before we've gone very far, and take
in these lower hills."</p>

<p>After they had ridden a mile farther, Joe turned
to the north or northwest, while Jack and Vicente
kept on until the Mexican pointed out a place where
he said Jack had better start north by himself, while
he went farther on.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>
<p>Jack sat for a moment watching the little horse
swinging easily along up the hill under the erect military
figure; and then, turning to his left, he started
to gallop over the ridges and ravines that cut the
slopes. It was killing work for a horse, up and down,
up and down, up and down. As much as he could,
Jack tried to save his animal by taking the hills at
an angle, but even at best it was such hard work that
Jack felt obliged often to stop, to let the horse rest
and breathe.</p>

<p>For some time he rode on without seeing any cattle,
but presently in a narrow valley, where evidently
water had stood late into the spring, he saw ten or
a dozen cows and young stock feeding on a little
flat from which they had nipped off all the tall grass,
so that at a distance the green carpet looked as if
it had been gone over by a lawn-mower.</p>

<p>The cattle saw him almost as soon as he saw them,
and seemed wilder than any he had previously come
across. In a moment their heads were down, and
their tails up and they were bolting across the ridges
at a lively gait. Their direction was just that which
Jack was taking, or perhaps they bore off a little to
the left, which would bring them down more toward
Joe's line. At all events, there was no reason to
hurry after them, for they would certainly be gathered
by one of the three men.</p>

<p>As Jack looked up toward the hill he could occasionally
see Vicente crossing an open space, going
at a good rate and apparently thinking nothing of
his horse. Yet, oddly enough&mdash;and Jack as well as
others of the round-up boys had often wondered at it&mdash;Vicente's
horses, even though he had a string of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>only six and seemed to work them twice as hard as any
other horses on the round-up, were always in good
spirits, fat and springy. Now and then on the hillside
above, and always in advance of Vicente, he
could see little bunches of cattle hurrying along. He
kept a sharp lookout to his right, thinking that possibly
some of those being driven by the Mexican
might turn off and drift down the hill in his direction,
and if they did so he did not wish to go so far, or
so carelessly, as to leave them behind.</p>

<p>Keeping his eye out warily, both up and down the
hill, he presently saw above him, rushing diagonally
to the front, five black-tail deer, none of them with
horns&mdash;apparently an old doe, two yearlings and two
spotted fawns. They had been startled either by
Vicente or by the cattle he was driving, and now
were making great time down the hill and toward
safety. Even for them the work of crossing these
ridges was tiring, and before long Jack could see that
the old doe's tongue was hanging out of her mouth
and that she was beginning to lose her wind. Jack
had no cattle immediately in front of him, and he
was riding down into a rather wide valley with a
flat bottom. As the deer were drawing near, and
would apparently cross in front of him, he put his
horse into a fast gallop in order to reach the top of
the next ridge about the time the deer got there. This
he succeeded in doing, and as he rode up on top of
the ridge and drew rein just below some scrubby pine
trees, he could see the deer coming at a gallop along
the top of this ridge, apparently intending to follow
it down to the lower country, instead of continuing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>their way across the ravines. Jack was partly hidden
by the trees, and was making no movement. The
deer kept on along the ridge, slackening their pace
as they got near to him, until just before they reached
the pine trees the two leading does were trotting,
the two fawns had almost stopped and the old doe
was coming along heavily in the rear. By the pines
they all stopped and looked back up the hill, as if
to try to learn what had become of the cause of their
alarm. They were so close to Jack that he could
readily have thrown a rope over the head of any one of
them. Their red flanks were heaving and the old
doe was quite tired. The little fawns, which could
not have been more than six weeks or two months
old, were the embodiment of grace and lightness.</p>

<p>After looking back for a moment or two, the deer
seemed to feel that there was nothing more to fear
from the enemy that had frightened them up the hill.
Two or three times they looked at Jack, but neither
he nor his horse moved, and after a stare or two
the deer looked unconcernedly away. Presently, with
a slow, almost slouching, gait, they started to walk
on down the ridge toward some underbrush on the
hillside; and in doing this they crossed the wind
which was blowing from the southeast, and so, in
their changed position, blew from Jack to them. As
each deer walked into this tainted current it bounded
into the air as if shot up by a gigantic spring, and
coming down again, the headlong flight was resumed
with every appearance of terror. It was not the first
time that Jack had seen something of this sort, and
Hugh had more than once spoken to him of the effect
of the scent of man on wild animals; but to-day
Jack wondered at it as much as he had ever done
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>before. The deer had looked squarely at him without
recognizing him as anything dangerous or hostile,
but the instant that their noses told them that he was
there, they raced off in headlong flight.</p>

<p>A few more ridges surmounted, and Jack came
again upon the little bunch of cattle that he had
started in the morning. Though still wild, they did
not rush off in the same alarm that they had shown
earlier in the day. Above them on the hillside and
near the head of the same ravine were other cattle
lying on the steep side hill, and Jack, riding up,
started them on their way. These animals had evidently
just lain down after feeding, and were not at
all wild. It seemed probable to Jack that he might
have to do some literal cow punching with these logy
beasts, and he took them down the hill with him and
started them forward about in the line that he was
riding.</p>

<p>All through the morning this went on, and Jack
had gathered forty or fifty head of cattle, while from
what he could see on the hillside above him Vicente
had a still larger bunch. It was impossible to get any
idea of what Joe was doing, because the slope here
was too gradual.</p>

<p>In the early afternoon it was evident that Vicente
had turned his cattle down the hill toward Jack.
Many of them showed themselves working down
ahead of him, and now and then he could hear the
whistles and calls by which Vicente was urging them
on.</p>

<p>It was not long after this that Vicente was seen
hurrying along the hillside up and down, gathering
the cattle into a more or less close bunch, and then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>starting them down a ridge ahead of Jack. A little
later, too, Jack began to see cattle coming from his
left&mdash;from down the hill. He therefore stopped
where he was, and getting up on as high a point as
possible, looked over the ground to get an idea of
the situation. Evidently this had been a pretty fruitful
gather, for there must have been more than three
hundred cattle brought along by Vicente and by Joe,
and as yet it was only a little after noon.</p>

<p>After a time, as the animals got together in a
fairly close bunch ahead of Jack, Vicente rode up to
him; and presently Joe appeared from a ravine.
The three stopped and got off and sat down on the
ground, and Joe and Vicente rolled cigarettes. The
tired horses panted and the sweat dropped from their
saddle cinches.</p>

<p>"Lots of cattle here," said Vicente. "We bring
in big bunch to-night; hard on the horses, though.
Lots of places in this rough country where cattle can
hide."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Joe, "that's sure so. I ought to
have a fresh horse now; mine's near give out."</p>

<p>"Well," said Jack, "I've been having an easy time,
I reckon. I haven't done much of anything except
to keep right straight ahead. My horse is tired too,
but not so tired as those you two have been riding."</p>

<p>"Suppose we get lot more cattle," said Vicente;
"we'll have a bunch too big for you to handle; then
we'll have to take 'em out of the hills and drive 'em
to camp; but we've not much farther to go now."</p>

<p>"No," answered Jack; "I suppose it's not much
farther, and I guess we can keep these going all right;
but I'll have my work cut out for me if any of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>cattle should be mean and try to break back, as they
are liable to. I'll have to do some riding myself."</p>

<p>"Some of these cattle are pretty wild," said Vicente.
"I started three or four bunches that tried hard to
break back, but now that they're together in a big
bunch they'll be easier to handle. Only, Jack, look
out and don't lose any in these ravines."</p>

<p>"All right; I'll try," Jack promised.</p>

<p>A little later, the three mounted again and Jack
rode down toward the cattle and put the bunch in
motion. It was slow work to get them started, but
as Jack went along he could see from the tops of the
ridges he crossed that the range of hills along which
they had been working bent away to the east just
ahead of him, and that before long he would have
the cattle on smoother ground where it would be
easier to watch them and to keep them traveling
straight. Now the ravines began to grow wider and
shallower. Joe joined him with a few more head,
and at length they got the bunch out into fairly flat
country. A little later, Vicente was seen off to the
right coming with a few more cows; and presently
the herd with the three riders guiding it was traveling
slowly along under its cloud of dust toward the
camp, which they could now see ahead of them.</p>

<p>The sun was still pretty high above the western
horizon when they drove the cattle down to the stream
to drink, and after that began to work them over to
where the main herd was feeding.</p>

<p>"I suppose," Jack said to Vicente, "that now we
have got so many cattle we'll have to spend a day
or two cutting and branding calves."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Vicente; "I think so. Seems to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>me I saw a big lot of strays in this bunch that we've
got ahead of us. Not many brands of people around
here. I don't know where they come from. Some
of the brands I don't know."</p>

<p>"That's right," put in Joe. "I've seen plenty of
brands that are new to me. Say, Vicente," he went
on, "there's a big fat maverick heifer among those
that I gathered. I wonder if McIntyre wouldn't
like to kill her for beef?"</p>

<p>"You sure she's got no brand on?" asked Vicente.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"Suppose you ride to camp and ask McIntyre, and
maybe we can cut her out before we get to the herd."</p>

<p>"All right," said Joe; and galloped off in the direction
of the camp.</p>

<p>Before long he returned, riding a fresh horse.</p>

<p>"McIntyre says to bring that maverick over to
the camp, and we'll kill her there," he reported.</p>

<p>No sooner said than done. Vicente and Joe pushed
their horses into the bunch of cattle and before long
had cut out the unbranded heifer, which was very
fat, and were driving her back to the camp. A little
later the herd Jack was driving mingled with
the main herd, and he also turned toward camp; but
before he got there he heard a shot, and as he rode
into the camp he could see two of the boys dressing
the young cow.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br /><br />

<small><small>THE FENCELESS LAND</small></small></h2>


<p>The next day Jack was ordered to travel with the
herd in company with Jack Mason and Rube. Mason
was a man who had not been long in this part of
the country. He was not a pilgrim, for he had been
born among the mountains of the West, and had spent
all his life in the fenceless country. As a very young
man he had worked his way up to the north, and for
several years had lived on or near the Blackfeet Reservation,
and Hugh knew him well. When he found
him in the round-up camp Hugh had spoken of him
to Jack in high terms.</p>

<p>"He's harum-scarum," he had said, "but he's a
good prairie man, and I don't think he's afraid of
anything that wears hair or feathers. He does not
always believe in obeying laws that he does not approve
of, and I've heard he has been in trouble once
or twice on that account; but he's a square man, and
a man that it's safe for you to know, and to tie to
under ordinary conditions. Sometimes, however, he
goes off half-cocked, and when he does that I shouldn't
want you to tie to him. He's a man that's growing
better every day, but he needs experience and balance,
and I don't believe there's any way for Jack Mason
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>to get that, except by living in the world and finding
out for himself a whole lot of things that he
don't know yet.</p>

<p>"There's another thing about Mason," Hugh went
on; "he's terrible stout, quick with his hands, and
quite a wrestler. I mind the only time I ever saw
him wrestle. The fellow that tackled him got a
handful. It was at the Blackfeet Agency. A big
husky chap came over from Canada and went around
blowing about how good he could wrestle. He threw
the blacksmith, who was pretty stout, and a big Indian
that was persuaded to try him, and after he had
done that he talked louder than ever. He was an
Englishman that had been in the mounted police.
Finally somebody who had seen Mason in a scuffle
told the man that he couldn't throw Mason, and the
Englishman wanted to bet he could, and at last got
all worked up about it. Mason kept refusing and
dodging and putting off, until the Englishman was
about crazy to make a match, and at last Mason said
he would go him. They put up five dollars a side to
wrestle on the flat out in front of the stockade.
When they got hold of each other, the Englishman
started in to throw Mason quick, but however hard
he tried, he didn't seem to stir him out of his tracks.
But suddenly, while they were all watching and wondering
what was going to happen, Mason give a kind
of a twist and threw the Englishman over his head,
and he lit on his back three or four steps away, with
the wind all knocked out of him. It took five or ten
minutes to bring him to, and then he was only just
able to walk, and had to be helped back into the
stockade. He didn't talk much about wrestling after
that, and left in the course of two or three days.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>
<p>"You notice Mason sometime when he's in swimming
and see his arms and shoulders, and the pins
he's got under him. He's stout, I tell you."</p>

<p>Mason was a good cow hand and a most cheery,
delightful fellow. No matter how gloomy the situation,
how hard the rain poured or the cold wind blew,
he whistled and sang in hearty fashion, made jokes
and laughed at those of others, and altogether got
out of life a great deal of enjoyment.</p>

<p>Those who were to drive the herd went out early
to relieve the night herders. They were in no haste
to start the cattle, which were given some time to
feed before being pushed along to the next camp.
While the cattle were feeding they needed no special
attention for they were not likely to try to wander
until they had eaten their fill. So the three herders
got together on a knoll from which a good view of
the country could be had, and sat there watching the
stock as it fed. Rube whittled tobacco, and time and
again filled his old black pipe; but the two Jacks,
being non-smokers, looked over the wide plain before
them, and noted, as one may note if one sits
down and stares at a landscape, the various things
that were happening among the wild dwellers of that
landscape.</p>

<p>Scarcely half a mile to the north was an old doe
antelope which in the early morning light had seemed
much interested in the cattle and trotted down toward
them on a tour of inspection. Those who saw
her felt pretty sure that hidden somewhere in the
neighborhood she had a couple of little kids; and sure
enough after the old mother had satisfied herself
that there was no danger in those great groups of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>dark animals, her two tiny young ones came out from
their hiding-place and played around her.</p>

<p>Along a distant hillside off to the south, Jack Mason's
keen eye detected a moving object, and after
watching it for a while he turned to Jack.</p>

<p>"There goes a wolf, traveling back after his night's
hunting to find a place to lie by during the day," he
said.</p>

<p>After it had been pointed out, they could see the
great beast trotting smoothly along over the prairie
toward some bushy ravines higher up on the hill.</p>

<p>"Except for the cattle and the wild animals," Mason
said, "there's not much to be seen here."</p>

<p>"Not much," answered Jack. "It's lonely; but
I like the very lonesomeness of it."</p>

<p>"Yes," responded Mason; "so do I. I don't know
anything much better than to ride along over the
prairie, or to sit alone on top of the hill and just see
what goes on all about you. Most people wouldn't
see anything, but the man that has got his eyes open
sees a whole lot."</p>

<p>"Ho!" put in Rube, "you fellows talk as if you
had never before been where it was lonely. I have;
and there's too much loneliness out here for me. I'm
getting to be like the fellow I heard of who was
riding fence down in Texas on one of those big fenced
ranches. He never saw anybody from week-end to
week-end, and one time when he came into a ranch
to get his supplies, he said it was so darned lonely
out there that he'd got into the habit of taking off
his hat and saying 'Howdy' to every fence post that
he passed."</p>

<p>"Well," laughed Mason, "he must have suffered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>for lack of company; but I would never have that
complaint."</p>

<p>"Hugh tells me that you've lived up in the Piegan
country," said Jack, addressing Mason. "Were you
up there long?"</p>

<p>"Three or four years. I expect I'll go back there
before long. Six or eight years ago I drifted up from
the south through this country, and finally brought
up among the Piegans. I've been across the line a
few times to the British, and have stopped a little
while with the Bloods and the north Piegans. You
know that in old times, when the first treaties were
made, the Piegans split up on the question of where
they should live. Some of them liked the country to
the south of the line, and some that to the north.
Originally all the three tribes of the Blackfeet came
from way up north on the Red Deer River, or maybe
still farther, to the east of that. I've heard old John
Monroe&mdash;maybe you know him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I should say so!" exclaimed Jack. "I lived in
his lodge all one summer."</p>

<p>"Well," continued Mason, "I've heard old John
Monroe tell a mighty good story about the way the
Blackfeet came down from the northeast, and how
they first met the white people."</p>

<p>Here Rube interrupted.</p>

<p>"I think we had better start these cows along. A
lot of 'em have quit feeding and the first thing we
know they'll be lying down, and then we'll have a
hard time to get them to move. Better come on and
start 'em now. The longer we put it off the harder
work and slower it'll be."</p>

<p>"That's gospel," said Jack Mason. "We've got
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>to whoop these cows up, and we haven't any time for
writing ancient history now."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Jack, "I suppose we've got to move;
but look here, Mason, I want to get you to tell me
that story, if you will. I've an idea that I've heard
bits of it up North, but if you can give it to me in a
connected fashion I wish you would."</p>

<p>"Why sure," Mason answered. "I'd like to tell
it to you the best I can; but you know very well that
I can't tell it the way old John Monroe could. He's
half Indian and that means that he's a natural sign
talker; and then he's got a dash of French in him,
that makes him willing to talk, and he talks well; and
then I expect the Scotch&mdash;for old Hugh Monroe's
father must have been Scotch, if the name counts for
anything&mdash;gives him a sense of humor. So he's a
rattling good story-teller. Of course, for me, and
maybe for you, he's sometimes a little hard to understand,
because he talks a language made up of English,
French, Cree and Blackfeet. Sometimes I miss
the connection, but his stories are always good. The
best ones that I ever heard, though, were those that
he told in Cree to Billy Jackson, and that Billy Jackson
interpreted for me, for Jackson is no slouch of
a story-teller himself."</p>

<p>As they talked, the men rode over toward the cattle
and going about them started those that were lying
down and at last got the whole bunch moving very
slowly in the direction they wished them to go.
Among the cattle were three or four partially crippled
animals that had been lamed either by the horns of
other cows in the crowding, or by falling in bad places.
Most of the hurts were trifling and would soon pass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>away, but there was one two-year-old steer that had
a very bad shoulder and could use only one foreleg.
He could get along very slowly and with difficulty.
As Rube and Jack passed each other, riding to and fro
to keep the stock going, Rube pointed to the steer.</p>

<p>"I hate to drive that cripple," he said; "and I'd
leave him in a minute if I wasn't afraid that the
wolves or coyotes would kill him to-night."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Jack; "I am afraid if he were
left behind he would never see the morning light;
even a bunch of coyotes could kill him without any
trouble, for just as soon as they crippled his hind
legs, he would fall over and they would eat him
alive."</p>

<p>"I reckon," decided Rube, "the best that we can
do is to keep him going, and if we get him into camp
to-night, we'll let McIntyre say what shall be done
with him."</p>

<p>About noon the boys came to a stream and, driving
the cattle down to it, made up their minds that
they would give them an hour or two of rest. When
Mason came up, Jack spoke to him about the crippled
steer and asked what he thought about it, repeating
what he and Rube had said a little while before.</p>

<p>"You're right about that," said Mason. "I don't
believe he'd last out the night; for, as you say, the
coyotes would kill him. If he were well, he could
stand off a bunch of coyotes, but as he is, he wouldn't
last long. You talk about crippling up his hind legs.
Do you savvy, Jack, how it is that a buffalo or a
steer, or a cow, gets hamstrung?"</p>

<p>"I always supposed that a wolf just bit through
that big tendon that runs down from the ham to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>hock, and, of course, if that's cut or broken that
cripples that leg entirely."</p>

<p>"Right you are," said Mason, "up to a certain
point; but did it ever occur to you how big and tough
that tendon is, and did you ever stop to think whether
a wolf could bite through it with one snap of his
jaws?"</p>

<p>"No; I confess that I never did. But now that you
speak of it, it looks to me like a pretty good-sized
contract for any animal to bite through that tendon
at a single snap."</p>

<p>"That's what it is," answered Mason. "If you
ever get a chance to try a knife on that tendon you'll
find that unless the knife is sharp like a razor you'll
have to put in a good deal of force, and do some
little sawing to get the blade through the tendon.
We all know that a wolf is big and strong and that
he can bite tremendously hard, and that he's got
sharp teeth. I believe that maybe a wolf has force
enough in his jaws to break a man's wrist, if he caught
it just at the right point, but I don't believe that there
ever was a wolf whelped that was able to cut through
that tendon at a single snap, unless by accident. Of
course, he might partly cut through it, and the animal's
struggles might break it, but I don't believe that
would happen once in a thousand times. The way
the wolves hamstring these animals, so far as I've
been able to see, is by biting that tendon over and over
again, and before long it gets all bruised and more or
less shredded, and swells up and stiffens, and the animal
is not able to use his leg. If this happens to one
or both legs, the first thing you know the animal is
down and that's the end of it."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>
<p>"Well, that's news to me," declared Jack. "I
never thought of that before. I always just took it
for granted that a wolf, because he is big and strong,
could and did cut through that tendon by a snap of
his jaws; but the way you put it, it looks to me as
if that would not be possible."</p>

<p>"I've seen a number of cases," Mason continued,
"where animals have been killed by wolves and I've
always been interested in hearing about this hamstringing,
so I've paid particular attention to the condition
of that part of the leg, trying to see whether
the tendon was ever cut, and I never have seen a
case when it was cut."</p>

<p>"That's a new idea to me," repeated Jack. "I'd like
to get more light on it. Did you ever talk about it to
Hugh? He's been on the prairie an awful long
time."</p>

<p>"No; I don't think that I ever talked about it to
anybody at all; but I'm like you, I'd like to know
whether it is gospel or not. At all events, it's what
I've seen, and I think it's reason, too."</p>

<p>"It does seem reasonable," said Jack. "Let's ask
Hugh when we get in to-night. Meantime we'll try
to push along this cripple and let McIntyre decide
what's to be done with him."</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when the herd was
turned out to feed near the camp; and at night, soon
after McIntyre got in, Jack told him the story of the
crippled steer, and asked what should be done with
it.</p>

<p>"Whose is it?" asked McIntyre.</p>

<p>"One of the Sturgis steers."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," said McIntyre, "you and old man Johnson
can decide what's to be done with it; and whatever
you say goes."</p>

<p>Hugh, when consulted, thought that the best thing
was to leave it behind them on the prairie, and that
it must take its chances of living or dying. With
rest and feed it would probably recover, but if driven
along with the herd it would be sure to get worse and
finally would have to be killed.</p>

<p>"All right," McIntyre consented; "when we move
from here we'll leave it, and let it take its chance.
We'll stop over here to-morrow, and cut and brand."</p>

<p>That night as they sat around the fire, Jack asked
Mason to tell Hugh what he thought took place when
an animal is hamstrung, and then asked Hugh what
his beliefs were about the matter.</p>

<p>"Why," replied Hugh, as he stuffed down the fire
in his pipe with a callous forefinger, "of course,
Mason is dead right. I supposed everybody knew that.
Hamstringing buffalo and stock means, I suppose,
crippling them by hurting that big tendon above the
hock. I've heard that in old days sometimes the
Mexicans, and maybe the Indians too, used to ride
up behind a buffalo with a right sharp saber or machete
and by making a strong downward stroke did actually
cut the hamstring and hurt the buffalo so that it had
only three legs to go on; but I never supposed that
anybody thought a wolf could really cut a hamstring
through in that way. It's just the way Jack Mason
says, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, and you'll
find that most mountain men and most Indians who
have seen anything will tell you just the same thing.</p>

<p>"I expect you read a whole lot in books that's written
by men who never saw the things happen that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>they describe: they've read of them perhaps a good
many times, and sort of take it for granted that what
they've read is all right; but, really, they don't know
what it means. I guess this hamstringing business
is one of those things. As Mason says, it might
happen now and then that a wolf's jaws that hit that
tendon just right would partly cut it in two, and then
the animal might break it in struggling, but that
wouldn't happen often."</p>

<p>"There's another thing, Hugh," Jack said, "that I
want Mason to tell you&mdash;about some things he's
heard from old John Monroe&mdash;some stories about
how the Piegans came from their old home in the
North down to where they live now. I want to get
him to tell us about that."</p>

<p>"Why, yes," replied Hugh, "those are right good
stories. I've often heard old John Monroe and other
old men talk about that. I supposed maybe I'd told
you about it, but I don't know as I have."</p>

<p>"No; I don't think you ever told me the whole
story, though I've heard you and other people up there
talk about it as something that was perfectly well
known."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," answered Hugh; "it's well known all
right. All the old men know about it, but lots of
the young men don't know anything at all about it.
They don't care much about those old stories. All
they want to do is to be riding horses; or maybe some
of them, if they should have a dollar or so, go off down
to the Birch Creek and buy some whisky with it."</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose it's too late to hear the story
to-night; but to-morrow night, if you feel like it, I'd
like to have you tell us those stories, Mason. You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>would like to hear them over again, wouldn't you,
Hugh?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Hugh; "I'd like to mighty well."</p>

<p>"Me, too," said Tulare Joe, as he threw the stump
of his cigarette into the fire and rose to go to his
blankets.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br /><br />

<small><small>TANNING A BUCKSKIN</small></small></h2>


<p>When Joe learned that the camp was not to move
the next day he told Jack that here was his opportunity
to tan his deer hide, and that after the work of cutting
and branding was over he would speak to McIntyre
about doing this job of tanning. There were
men enough to do herd duty, and the boys thought
that in the few hours of daylight that remained after
the day's work was done they could get the skin in
fair shape.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Joe, "we can't make a good
job of it; an Indian has all the time there is, and
he does his tanning slowly and does it well. We'll
have to be satisfied with a rough job, but anyhow
we can get the hide fairly soft, and it can be worked
on again later."</p>

<p>As soon as the outfit had got into camp in the
afternoon, Joe went to the cook tent and borrowed
Frank's spade, and going down near to the stream
and choosing a place where the grass grew fairly
thick, he began to dig a hole considerably larger than
a water bucket. When he had made the hole a foot
and a half deep, he got into it and tramped down
the soil on the bottom, scraping up anything that was
loose and finally leaving a fairly smooth and hard
surface. While working at this, he asked Jack to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>go to the wagon and bring the skin, and also the skull
of the deer, which was tied to one of the bows of
the wagon near the hide. Jack presently returned
with both.</p>

<p>"I didn't know you had saved the skull, Joe," he
said; "it looks as if it had been partly cooked. Did
you save it for the brains?"</p>

<p>"Just for that," was the reply. "You know, of
course, that the brains is a pretty important part of
the operation of tanning. I did think I might get
the brains of a beef from some animal that we'd
kill, but of course we never could be sure of having
a chance to do our tanning just after the beef had
been killed, so I thought I'd save this skull; and to
keep it from spoiling I stuck it in the ashes that night
we skinned the deer, and hauled some coals over it,
and asked Frank not to throw it away if he found it.
It sort of cooked and dried during the night, and
doesn't seem to have spoiled a bit."</p>

<p>By this time the hole seemed to suit Joe. He took
the deer's hide and cut the string which bound it to
the willow hoop, then began to fold it&mdash;taking care
not to break the skin&mdash;until he made it into a more
or less square package, flesh side out, somewhat less
in size than the bottom of the hole. He placed it in
the bottom of the hole, and put on it a rather heavy
stone to hold it in position. Then, taking a bucket,
he went down to the stream and brought two or three
bucketfuls of water which he poured into the hole
until it was almost full.</p>

<p>"This hole is close to the camp, and nothing is
likely to disturb the skin during the night," he said;
"but the coyotes might find it, and I don't mean to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>take any chances, so I'm going to cover it up. Maybe
Frank will lend us the tail gate of his wagon to
put over it. I'll ask him, anyhow."</p>

<p>The cook, on being appealed to, declined to lend
the tail gate of the cook wagon.</p>

<p>"Why don't you get the tail gate of the bed wagon
and use that?" he suggested.</p>

<p>Joe at once did so. He carried the end gate out
and placed it over the hole, and the boys put two or
three heavy stones on it.</p>

<p>"Now," said Joe, "I need a sort of beam to use
in scraping the hair off this hide, and I reckon one
of these young cottonwoods will do. I wish we had
a tree right here to rest it against."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with that box elder over there
with the low fork? If you make your pole long
enough you can rest it in that fork."</p>

<p>"Right you are," said Joe. "I'll go down and get
one of those young trees and you'd better come along,
because that green wood is pretty heavy, and if we
cut a long pole it'll take us both to pack it over."</p>

<p>The grove was only fifty yards away, and Joe soon
felled a young tree, which was six or eight inches
through at the butt. Cutting fifteen feet off the
larger end, he and Jack carried it over and soon wedged
it in the fork of the box elder, only a short distance
from the hole where the hide was soaking.</p>

<p>"Now," Joe explained, "I've got to peel this stick,
because any little lumps on the bark are likely to make
us cut the hide."</p>

<p>They set to work and in a few minutes the lower
five or six feet of the pole was free from its bark and
shone white in the sun. They looked over the wood,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>and shaved down one or two little lumps until the
surface of the peeled wood was quite smooth.</p>

<p>"There," exclaimed Joe; "that's all we can do to-night.
My scraper is in my bed. I tied that up to
the bows of the wagon until it got dry; and to-morrow,
after our work is done, it won't take long to
scrape the hair from the hide and to put on the brains.
I'd like to have a day more to work on the thing,
but we've got to do the best we can in the time we
have."</p>

<p>The next day, after the work was over and the
horses turned out, Joe repaired to the hole where the
hide was soaking, and Jack went with him. Again
they had recourse to the cook, who, after some grumbling,
gave them half a dozen nails.</p>

<p>When the tail gate of the wagon was removed, the
boys discovered that much of the water in the hole
had soaked away into the soil, and the top of the
stone on the deer hide was above the water. The hide,
however, was still covered. After the stone had been
removed and the hide taken out, they found it perfectly
soft and pliable.</p>

<p>Joe carried it down to the stream and thoroughly rinsed
it there, thus removing all the earth which clung to it.
When he took it from the water he squeezed from it
all the moisture that he could, then carried it up and
hung it over the leaning pole, hair side out, and head
toward the upper end. Now, with a stone, he drove
a couple of nails into the pole and to them he fastened
the head of the hide. Then he produced his scraper.
Jack at once recognized it as a part of the deer's foreleg&mdash;the
double bone that runs down from the elbow
to meet the deer's wrist&mdash;what is usually called the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>knee. Of course Jack knew that in the hoofed animals
the bone of the upper arm, which is called the humerus,
is altogether hidden within the body and that the joint
of the foreleg close to the body corresponds with man's
elbow. Joe's scraper was the bone running from this
elbow down to the deer's knee, and Jack was interested
and somewhat astonished&mdash;for he had never before
thought about the matter&mdash;to see what a splendid natural
scraper this bone made. He said as much to Joe.</p>

<p>"Didn't you ever notice," asked Joe, "how often an
Indian uses some natural and common thing for a tool
in his work? I've seen that often, and it always made
me wonder. Now you see this tool, in its curved shape
and with that thin edge there of one of the bones, makes
a great scraper. It's almost like a drawing-knife; and
then look at the two handles on the ends&mdash;ain't that
fine? The Indian that showed me how to tan, scraped
the edge of his bone and made it a little sharper than
this one is; but I reckon this will do all right; anyhow,
we'll try. Of course, if we hadn't saved this bone
from the deer's leg, we could have used a beef rib, or
even the back of a knife; but this is the best and handiest
thing I know of."</p>

<p>"That seems to me about a perfect tool for this
work," declared Jack; "and I wonder at it too."</p>

<p>Joe took the leg bone of the deer and standing before
the skin which hung over the pole, flesh side to
the wood, began with long even strokes to scrape the
hair from it. To Jack's surprise this came away
readily and evenly, leaving the naked hide smooth and
white. From time to time Joe shifted the skin, and
gradually removed the hair from the whole hide down
to the very edges, though on the head and ears the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>work was more raggedly done than on the neck, back
and sides. Before very long, though, the skin was
absolutely hairless, and as white on the hair side as it
was white on the flesh side when Joe turned it over.
It was quite free from superfluous tissue, for the boys
had cleaned it well before stretching it.</p>

<p>After the hair had all been removed, Joe took the
hide down to the stream and gave it a thorough washing,
kneading it together as if to get out of it all the
animal matter that had been left on it, and finally,
weighing it down with stones, left it there to soak.
Meanwhile he sent Jack back to the cook tent to bring
a wash basin with a little warm water; and when Jack
returned, he found that Joe had split the deer's skull.
In a moment the brains of the animal were turned
into the warm water, where they were crushed and
pulverized by the boys' fingers until the water was all
whitish and looked like soapsuds with a few white
particles floating in it.</p>

<p>"Really, these brains ought to be heated for a while
over the fire," explained Joe; "but we haven't much
time to fuss, and maybe the hot water will answer just
as well. What we want to do is to get these brains as
fine as we can, and then we must build a little fire
and warm the mixture again, and then put it on the
skin."</p>

<p>They got together a few small sticks and chips and
built a little fire; and then set the basin on it, having a
bucket partly full of water close by.</p>

<p>Then Joe went down to the stream where he had left
the hide soaking, and after shaking it about in the
water to free it from any sediment that might have
caught on it, he lifted it up and brought it to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>grass near the fire, and then folded it over to make
a long narrow piece. He took hold of one end, and
Jack of the other, and they twisted it and wrung out
almost all the water. It was surprising to Jack now
how little the hide looked like the deer skin of an
hour before. Two or three times the hide was unfolded
and stretched out and then doubled again and
the boys put all the power of their arms into the
wringing process.</p>

<p>"The best way," said Joe, "would be to knot the
skin around the limb of a tree and twist it just as
hard as a man can twist; but we can't do that now."</p>

<p>When all the water possible had been wrung from
the skin, it was unfolded, and Joe told Jack to help
him stretch it and get it again to something like its
natural shape. They worked for some time at this,
pulling against each other, across and sidewise of the
skin, and one hand pulling against the other at the
edges; then, when the skin had again taken somewhat
the shape of the dried hide of the day before, it was
spread on the grass as flat as possible.</p>

<p>Now Joe added water to the brains in the basin
which were just steaming, until he had increased the
quantity of the mixture about three times; and carrying
the basin over to where the hide lay, he began to
take the fluid in his hand and to spread it smoothly
over the hair side of the skin, rubbing it in as he did
so.</p>

<p>When Jack saw what was being done, he took hold
also, and soon the whole skin was covered with the
mixture, which was rubbed in and kneaded with the
knuckles, especially near the edges of the hide and
about the head and neck.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>
<p>"They say," explained Joe, "that the main part of
the tanning is the way you put the brains on, and the
way you work the thing dry afterward."</p>

<p>By this time the sun was getting low.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether we'll be able to finish this
chore to-night or not," Joe said. "After the brains
have been put on, it ought to be left in the sun to be
set up and then it ought to be dried; but I'm afraid
we can't do that. We'll have to quit now before very
long."</p>

<p>After the brains had been thoroughly applied, Joe
began to fold and roll up the skin until it was in a
tight ball; and then he sat down and made a cigarette.</p>

<p>"That's about as far," he said, "as we'll be able to
go to-night. Before we go to bed I'll spread the skin
out, and to-morrow we'll have to let it dry in the
wagon. I'm afraid it won't be much of a job of tanning:
it's had to be done too fast and spread out over
too much time. If we were going to lie over here
to-morrow, I'd give it a good soaking in water and
then start in to work it soft and dry; but that's something
that'll have to wait."</p>

<p>This was what had to be done; and the next morning
when Jack looked into the cook wagon where the
hide was again tied to the bows, he saw that it had
greatly shrunk, and though it had the color of buckskin,
it looked almost like a piece of rawhide.</p>

<p>A few days later, Jack and Joe, having two or three
hours which they could devote to finishing their tanning,
again set to work at the hide. As soon as they
came into camp, Joe looked up a place in the shade
where the water was deep, and put the hide there to
soak. Then, when they were able to get at it, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>gave it a thorough washing and rinsed it many times
in the water, and then took it over to a nearby tree
which had low branches on it. Here one end of the
hide was doubled about a branch and the other fastened
to a short stout stick, and first Joe, later relieved
by Jack, twisted the hide rope against the branch
until the water was again all out of it. Once more it was
taken down as before and pulled and stretched on its
edges until it was brought back nearly to its natural
shape. Then Joe, taking off his shoes and stockings,
sat down on the ground and began to pull the hide
this way and that, often throwing the hide over his
feet and slowly dragging it over the feet toward the
body. He rubbed the hide between his hands, shifting
the hands constantly, and with a motion as if he
wished to break up the fiber of the skin. Jack watched
him and when he saw the purpose of this manipulation
sat down beside him and helped.</p>

<p>"The northern Indians, Joe," he said, "have what
seems to me a better plan than that&mdash;they have a
rope running from the top of a pole down to a pin
in the ground and pull the hide back and forth over
that. Or I've seen them tie up a buffalo shoulder-blade
with a big hole cut in it to a pole, and, passing
the deer skin right through the hole in the bone, they
pull it backward and forward through that. It's a
labor-saving scheme; I guess very likely it doesn't
make quite as good buckskin as your way, but it
saves a whole lot of elbow-grease."</p>

<p>"I should think it would," answered Joe; "and
what's the matter with trying that rope scheme right
now? I'll go to my saddle and get my rope and we
can drive a pin in the ground here; and between you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>and me I believe we can soften that thing in pretty
short order."</p>

<p>While Joe had gone for the rope, Jack whittled a
long sharp pin notched at the larger end; and after
Joe had fastened the rope to a branch above, they
drew it tight down to the pin and fixed it there securely,
and in a few moments were hard at work
softening the hide by pulling it backward and forward
against the rope. It was extraordinary how
soft and limp the hide became and how soon it began
to look like real buckskin. When the hide was quite dry
and they took it off and felt it, Jack congratulated Joe
on having done a mighty good job of tanning.</p>

<p>That night in camp he showed the buckskin to
Hugh, who praised it highly, and said that when
smoked it would make part of a good shirt.</p>

<p>"You've got to smoke it, though," said Hugh, "or
else every time it gets wet it will stiffen up and be
just like a board, and will have to be rubbed soft
again."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know, of course, it's no good until it has
been smoked," replied Joe; "but in this camp we've
got to do our tanning when we can, and there won't be
any chance to smoke it until the next time we lie over
somewhere."</p>

<p>"Well," suggested Hugh, "why don't you wait until
you get your other buckskin? Then you can sew them
together to make a kind of bag, and build a small smoke
and fix your bag up over the fire so that the smoke will
go into the mouth of the bag."</p>

<p>"That would be a good idea," said Joe. "I guess
we'll wait for our other buckskin first."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br /><br />

<small><small>INDIAN STORIES</small></small></h2>


<p>The next day was one of hard work&mdash;cutting cattle
and branding calves; but as the number of cows in this
bunch was small, the work of separating the brands
and branding the calves was not so great as might have
been expected from the number of cattle to be worked.
There was an unusual number of strays, as the boys
had noticed for several days past, and these were all
turned into the big bunch which McIntyre proposed
to send over to the home range on the Pick Ranch.</p>

<p>So it happened that night that the boys were less
tired than after an ordinary day's work. Supper came
early and they lounged about the fire talking and smoking,
for the evening was cool and the warmth of the
fire pleasant. A sharp shower of rain had fallen in
the middle of the night before, more or less rousing
the sleepers, who had hurried about looking up their
slickers which they spread over their blankets. The
early morning was clear and bright, but cool, and
the higher hills in the distance showed that there the
rain had been snow, for they were white for a long distance
below their summits. The cool weather contributed
something to the ease of the day's work, and
during the morning there was less dust than usual, although
by midday all the moisture had dried, and the
powdery clouds of dust were as suffocating as they
usually are when cattle are being handled.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>
<p>Jack had not forgotten Mason's promise to tell him
John Monroe's story of the movements of the Blackfeet
tribes in early days; and not long after supper
he spoke to him about this. Mason was slow to respond,
declaring that Hugh Johnson probably knew
the story better than he, and could tell it if he would.
But after some persuasion Mason began.</p>

<p>"Well, according to old John Monroe, the way I
remember what he told me, it was like this:</p>

<p>"The old men say that a long time ago, in the time
of our grandfathers, or great-grandfathers, or even
back before that, the Blackfeet people used to live out in
the timber country away east of the Rocky Mountains.
In that land they were at war with people, who fought
with them and troubled them. Game was hard to get,
for their only weapons were arrows pointed with bits
of stone and with these weapons it was hard for them
to kill food. They had never been a people that ate
fish, but believed that all animals and all birds were
fit for food and could be eaten.</p>

<p>"John said that the attacks of their enemies and the
difficulty of getting food were the things that made
them move from that lower country up closer to the
mountains. He says that when he was a little boy,
and afterward when he was larger, he used to hear
in the lodge the talks between his mother and an old
Blood Indian named Su' ta ne. This old man may
have been some sort of relation to John, but about
that I don't know. At all events, Su' ta ne was then
very old, and the time he used to talk about was when
he was a little boy. Su' ta ne had heard his father
speak of the trouble that they used to have down in
the timber country, and said that it was in his father's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>boyhood that they began to move westward, traveling
up the Saskatchewan or some of the rivers that flow
into it. Su' ta ne said that it was when he was a little
boy that they first saw the Rocky Mountains; this, according
to John, must have been a long time ago. John
must be now sixty or sixty-five years old, and he said
that Su' ta ne was very old when he used to hear him
talk about this. If we say that John heard it fifty
years ago and that Su' ta ne was born when his father
was thirty, it carries the beginning of the movement
back a hundred and thirty or a hundred and forty
years, which, according to my guess, would be about
1745 or 50, and I reckon that was a long time before
any white man got into the country where those people
used to live. Maybe, though, it was a good deal
longer ago than that. I guess all John meant was that
it was long, long ago, and when Su' ta ne said that it
was in his father's time that they began to move toward
the mountains, he may have meant only that this
move was before he knew anything."</p>

<p>"I guess you're right there, Jack," said Hugh.
"Indians are mighty weak on dates, after they get
back farther than they themselves can remember."</p>

<p>"Yes," went on Mason, "I don't believe it's any
use to try to fix a date. It's bound to be guesswork.
Anyhow, old John said that Su' ta ne, when he described
the country that they lived in, said it was mostly
timbered, with stretches of prairie among the timber&mdash;something
like big parks, I reckon.</p>

<p>"It was in Su' ta ne's time, in his young days, as
I understood, that the Blackfeet, who had been slowly
drifting westward, at last reached the mountains.
When they got to the rough country they found there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>lots of game of all kinds, and found it very much easier
to get close to than it ever had been before. So they
thought that the change they had made was a mighty
good one; and that's the way they changed from a timber
living people to a mountain people. It was a good
while after this that they got horses and began to
travel around out on the prairie. The old men used
to tell John that the time they first ventured out on the
prairie was when they began to travel along the old
trail which still runs north and south along the mountains.
Of course, you know the old Red River cart
trail, Hugh, and very likely you too, Jack."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Hugh, "I know it; but I don't believe
son here has ever been on it."</p>

<p>"Old John Monroe believes thoroughly in this story,
and he naturally would, because it comes from his
mother, and his relations, but he says that all the old
Indians in that northern country believe in it just the
same as he does. He believes that the Crees and the
Blackfeet are relations, though he doesn't pretend that
they are very close relations.</p>

<p>"Well, according to old John, a while after the
Indians got up close to the mountains there, up North,
the white man came into the country; and when the
white men came, the Indians began to get guns. Before
that they had begun to get horses, maybe through
the Kutenais on the other side of the mountains; and
when they got guns and horses they began to take
courage and to venture out on the prairie. They began
to find out that they could fight their enemies and
take care of themselves. Besides this, they had learned
that while there were no horses north of them, the
tribes to the south had horses; and of course that led
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>to their going more and more to war, because everybody
wanted horses. They were about the most valuable
things that a man could get hold of. These
journeys to war and their fightings led to the Indians
moving south along the foot of the mountains, and out
on the prairie.</p>

<p>"Now of course I'm just telling you what John
Monroe told me. I don't know anything about it myself."</p>

<p>"Well," said Hugh, "I guess that's gospel; and it
always seemed to me that the names that the Blackfeet
have for the different points of the compass were
very good evidence that the Blackfeet did come from
the north. The Blackfeet word for north means back,
or behind, direction; while the word for south means
ahead, or before, direction. It seems to me mighty
natural that if people were traveling they should call
the direction that they had come from, behind direction,
and the one that they were going to, ahead direction.
Of course the two words for east and west they
called down direction and up direction. That doesn't
mean anything more than that the streams that they
crossed were flowing down hill toward the lower land;
while they were flowing from the higher land which
lay to the west."</p>

<p>"I never heard that before," said Mason. "That's
mighty funny; and it certainly seems to back up John
Monroe's story about their having come from the
north."</p>

<p>"Did John tell you," asked Hugh, "about the story
of the people getting separated?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Mason answered. "He told me that all the
Piegans believe that somewhere off in the southern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>country, there's a tribe of Piegans&mdash;at least a tribe
of people who speak the same language that the Piegans
talk&mdash;and they believe that those people are a
part of the Piegan tribe. I don't just remember how
they got separated, but I do recall that it was when
they were crossing a big water that the separation took
place. Do you remember it, Hugh?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hugh. "This was the story, as I heard
it. A long time ago a big camp of people, the whole
Piegan tribe, were traveling south and they came to a
big river and started to cross it on the ice. Of course,
in those days the tribe was a big one, and when they
marched they were strung out over a long distance.
Some of the people had already crossed the river; some
were yet on the ice; but most of them had not yet
come to the stream. As they were going along, a
child saw frozen in the ice a buffalo horn that was
shiny and pretty and cried for it. Some old woman
began to knock it loose, and while she was doing that,
suddenly the ice in the river broke up. Pretty much
all the Indians on the ice were drowned; and now there
was a big wide swollen stream full of running ice
separating the two portions of the tribe. Of course
the people could not sit down on the bank and wait for
the stream to go down, and starve to death. Each
party had to start out and look for food, and the two
parties never met again. So it is that the north Indians
still believe that somewhere off to the south there
are a lot of Blackfeet living as a tribe. Men say that
in their travels, either on the war-path or visiting other
tribes, they have met people who speak a language so
much like their own that they could understand them.
Nobody really knows anything about it."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>
<p>"Well," said Jack, "that's a great story. Wouldn't
it be fun to go around among the Indian tribes and try
to hunt up those Blackfeet and tell them about their
relations up North?"</p>

<p>"Yes," added Mason, "that's a good story. I remember
now that that's just about what John Monroe
told me; but I couldn't have told it the way Hugh did."</p>

<p>"It's a good story," said Hugh, "but it's a story
that a good many tribes of Indians tell. I've heard the
Cheyennes tell the same story; and the Sarcees, and
the Crows. Now I wonder if it isn't just some old
legend founded on something that maybe really did
happen once, but that has been adopted by half a dozen
tribes that don't seem to be any kin to each other, as
far as we know?</p>

<p>"One time, when I was younger and heard this
same story told by two tribes, I thought maybe I'd
found the people that used to belong to the Blackfeet;
but I reckon that's not so. You know, if you've traveled
around, that you'll find lots of different tribes
that have the same story and each tribe thinks the
story belongs to it. Nobody knows where that story
originally came from, nor to whom it actually belongs."</p>

<p>"Say, Hugh," Mason asked, "did you ever hear that
story told by John Monroe, about the first time the
north Indians saw the white people?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Hugh, "I've heard that story; but
a good while ago, and I don't feel sure that I could tell
it. Do you remember it well enough to give it to
us?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know that I do; but, if you'd like,
I'll try it."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>
<p>"Pitch in," said Hugh; and McIntyre added, "Go
it, Mason."</p>

<p>"This happened a long time ago, old John Monroe
said, but how long, of course, I can't tell, any more
than he could; but, according to the story, this was
the first time the Blackfeet ever saw any white people.
John said that old Su' ta ne told him the story and
Su' ta ne said that his grandfather was one of the
Blackfeet people. It happened when the Blackfeet
were living up North, as I've just told you about.
Here's the story:</p>

<p>"A party of Indians were traveling south, and while
they were going through a big patch of timber on the
north of some big river, they saw something that they
could not understand. It looked like beaver work
where beavers had been cutting down trees, but when
they looked at the stumps and the cuttings they could
see that no beaver that they knew anything about could
possibly have opened its mouth wide enough to cut
such chips. They talked and wondered about this and
finally concluded that the tree must have been cut down
by some mysterious animal. You know the Blackfeet
are great fellows for believing that there are strange
animals and people living under the water, and they
thought that this work must have been done by under-water
animals.</p>

<p>"Presently they came to a place where one of the
trees that had been cut down, after having its branches
lopped off, had been dragged along the ground. They
followed the trail, anxious to find out what was happening,
and as they followed it they saw that all through
the timber there were many other trails like this, and
that presently they all came together in one big trail,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>and in this trail they found tracks that looked like the
tracks of people, but they were not shaped like the
track of a human foot, and besides that, at the back of
this track there was a deep mark.</p>

<p>"Well, they followed the trail which was now getting
to be a big one, and presently they came to where
they could see that the timber ended and there was
an open spot beyond, and as they looked out through
the timber they saw some animals walking around on
their hind legs. For a minute they thought that they
were bears playing with sticks, but then they saw that
these looked like people, and that they were lifting
up logs and putting them in a great pile. As they
looked, they saw that some of these animals had a
great deal of hair or wool on their faces; they seemed
to be naked, for they wore no robes. Some had red
bodies and some black ones. So they saw that they
could not be people. As they talked about it, they concluded
that these were certainly some under-water animals,
but they wondered what they could be doing with
these sticks.</p>

<p>"They were frightened by what they saw, and fearing
that these animals might discover them and hurt
them, they finally started away and went back to their
own country without being seen. When they reached
home they told their story and the people who heard it
could not understand it, for they were told of something
that was wholly outside of their own experiences.
Here were people who were naked, who had red bodies,
or again were dark colored everywhere, except for a
red stripe around the body and a red tail.</p>

<p>"The story was so strange that pretty much all the
men in the camp wanted to know more about it&mdash;to see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>this wonderful sight for themselves; and so quite a
party started back to the place. When they reached
the open part of the timber, these mysterious animals
were still at work there. The head man of the Blackfeet
must have been a pretty plucky fellow, for he
ordered all his party to stay where they were, and said
that he would go out and meet these animals and try
to find out something about them. But he told his men
that if these strange creatures attacked him, they must
come out and help him.</p>

<p>"That Indian sure had plenty of sand. He walked
down toward these people; and when they saw him,
one of them walked up to him and stuck out his hand
and took the Indian's hand and moved it up and down.
The Indian looked at the white man and at the white
man's hand, but he had no idea what this meant, and did
nothing. Presently other white men came up to him,
and the Indian discovered that they were people like
himself, except that they had different voices and different
colored skin and hair.</p>

<p>"After a while, when the Indians in the timber saw
no harm had come to their chief, they came out a
few at a time and went down toward the white people.
The white people talked to them and made signs to
them, but the Indians could not understand what they
meant. At last, however, the whites managed to make
some of the Indians understand that they wanted them
to go into the house with them, and a number of them
went in; and as some time went by without anything
terrible happening, all the Indians began to take courage.</p>

<p>"In this house there were a great many wonderful
things. The white people carried knives in their belts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>and showed the Indians how these would cut. The
Indians were nearly tickled to death with the knives.
Then a great big white man showed them an ax, and
while they stood by he cut a big log in two in a very
short time; and when the Indians saw the chips fly they
began to understand the strange beaver work that they
had seen.</p>

<p>"One of the white men took down from the wall
something that the Indians thought was a long, straight
stick but when the man showed it to them they could
see that while part of it was made of wood a part was
made of a hard black stone. The white man kept making
signs about this stick, but they didn't know what
he meant. Pretty soon the man took a white cow's
horn, and out of it poured some black sand into his
hand and poured this into a hole at the end of the stick.
Then he made a little ball of grass and pushed this
into the hole with another stick; then out of a bag he
took something that was round and heavy and put that
into the hole, and pushed down some more grass; then
he poured some of the black sand into the side of the
stick. The Indians watched him do all these things,
and of course had no idea as to what it all meant.
After he had finished doing these things, the white
man made signs to the Indians and made a great noise
with his mouth, and pointed to the stick. He put the
stick to his shoulder, holding it out in front of him,
and made motions of many kinds. Presently he gave
the stick to one of the Indians, and put his finger on a
little piece of stone sticking out from beneath it. When
the Indian touched this under part, the stick made a
terrible noise and a big smoke, and flew out of the
Indian's hands, and he nearly fell down.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>
<p>"All the Indians were very much scared, and some
of them fell down, but all the white men laughed and
nodded, and made signs, but of course the Indians did
not understand them.</p>

<p>"Now the white man picked up the stick from the
ground where it had fallen and again took the horn
of black sand and did the same things to the stick as
before, but this time the Indians all stood away from
him. They didn't know what was going to happen.
After the white man had finished doing these things,
he persuaded them to come out of doors with him.
Then he sat down on the ground and put the stick to his
shoulder, pointing it toward a log that was lying on
the ground. Again the terrible noise was heard, but
the white man didn't let go the stick. He held it in his
hand. Then he got up and walked over to the log and
showed the bullet hole, and pushed a little stick into
it. Then he loaded the gun again.</p>

<p>"By this time the Indians were beginning to understand
the power of this stick; and at last, after the
white man had loaded the gun again and encouraged
the Indians, he took one of them close to the log and
showed him how to point the gun and how to pull the
trigger. The Indian fired and hit the log. I reckon
when he found that he had hit it he thought that he was
one of the biggest men in the country.</p>

<p>"Well, after a while the Indians and the white men
got to be pretty friendly. The Indians could see that
knives and axes and copper cups, to say nothing of
guns, were a heap better than anything they had; and
the white men on the other hand wanted the furs and
dresses that the Indians wore. They traded for them,
and after a while the Indians and the white people got
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>to know each other pretty well, and commenced to
trade regularly.</p>

<p>"And that's the story as I heard it."</p>

<p>"You told that mighty well, Mason," commented
Hugh; "a great deal better than anybody else could tell
it, except perhaps old John Monroe, or some of those
old Piegans."</p>

<p>"But I want a lot of explanation," said Joe. "What
about those fellows with the red tails? I don't savvy
that a bit. I can understand about the red bodies, because
I suppose that means they wore red shirts, but
what about the red tails?"</p>

<p>"Well, Joe," replied Hugh, "you've never been out
in that northern country or else you wouldn't ask a
question like that. The old voyageurs and people in
the North always used to wear a red sash tied around
their waist with the long ends hanging down in front.
When they were working, to get these ends out of the
way, they used to pass them around their body, and
then under the sash, so that they hung down behind."</p>

<p>"Well," laughed Joe, "that certainly is the limit."</p>

<p>"And," Jack said, "just think of their taking a tree
chopped down with an ax for one cut down by a
beaver; and their not knowing the foot-prints of a person
wearing a shoe!"</p>

<p>"Sho," drawled Hugh; "haven't I told you time
and again that we all of us measure up things by what
we ourselves have seen, and we find it hard to believe
anything that's outside the range of our own experience.
If there was any way of proving it, I'd be willing
to bet a good horse and saddle and bridle that if
we'd been there we'd all have acted just the way those
Indians did."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br /><br />

<small><small>BIG WOLVES</small></small></h2>


<p>It happened the next day that Jack was riding circle
on the far side of the ground that was being covered.
Almost all day he rode without seeing any cattle, and
it was well along in the afternoon when he came up
to the top of a ridge and stopped his horse just before
he reached its crest. Here he dismounted and, walking
up, peeped over to see what there might be on the other
side. This of course was not at all what most cowboys
would have done, but the habits of caution taught
Jack by Hugh in the early days of his travels in the
West were too firmly fixed to be overcome, and when
alone Jack always looked over a hill in this way.</p>

<p>Rather to his surprise he saw down in a little flat,
five hundred yards away, a small bunch of cattle&mdash;perhaps
eighteen or twenty head. This was a surprise,
partly because he had seen none during the day, but
chiefly because the cattle were close bunched, as if
brought together by a herder. For an instant he did
not comprehend what this meant, but then his eye
caught two gray animals&mdash;big wolves&mdash;which were
slowly walking about the herd. Evidently the cattle
had come together for protection, and were standing
there, heads out, ready to repel an attack if it should
be made on them. Jack felt that he ought to ride
down and drive off the wolves and bring the cattle in,
but, on the other hand, he was very curious to see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>what the wolves would do. More than once he had
seen coyotes trying to take from a cow a young calf
that was by her side, but this was the first time he had
seen big wolves round up cattle. He waited, therefore,
to see what would happen, thinking that after a little
while the wolves would probably give up the job and
go off in search of some single animal which they could
run down and kill, as he had once seen them do on his
way out from the railroad to his uncle's ranch.</p>

<p>For two or three minutes nothing happened, and
the wolves continued to walk around the bunch. Then,
suddenly, one of them made a dash at the bunch of
cattle, going so close to them that Jack expected to see
the wolf caught on a steer's horns and thrown into
the air. When the wolf rushed up, the bunch of cattle
seemed to tremble; that is to say, there was apparently
a slight movement by every individual in the
herd, and Jack recalled similar movements which he
had seen years before in British Columbia among a
school of salmon far below the surface of the water,
when some one darted down toward the fish a spear
which nearly reached them. It seemed to him that
every animal yielded a little, yet no one of them perhaps
moved more than six or eight inches.</p>

<p>A moment or two later one of the wolves made another
rush, which was followed by a similar slight
movement of the bunch; and then the wolves continued
their slow march about the cattle. This happened several
times, but at last when the wolf dashed toward the
bunch, one animal&mdash;a full-grown one&mdash;burst out
of the herd and started to run. In an instant the wolf
was behind it, between it and the other cattle; and a
moment later the second wolf had joined the first one,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>and they loped quietly along after the single animal.
Presently, running side by side, they drew up close to
its heels, and then, separating, one of them made a
vicious snap at the cow's leg while the other sprang
and caught it in the flank; and in an instant, too quickly
for Jack to see how it was done, the beast was on its
side and the wolves were tearing at its belly. Jack
jumped to his horse and rode over the ridge, charging
down toward the wolves. They paid no attention to
him until he was within less than a hundred yards, and
then, suddenly looking up, they galloped away. He
fired four or five shots after them, but without result.</p>

<p>The animal that they had pulled down was a two-year-old
heifer, big, strong and fat. Her whole flank
was torn out, and she was dead. There was nothing
to be done with her. The brand was not one with
which Jack was familiar, and he thought she was a
stray from some distant ranch. He drove the remaining
cattle slowly toward camp, and after a time met
some of the other boys bringing in another bunch, and
turned his in with theirs.</p>

<p>That night, after supper, he talked with Hugh about
the wolves and the harm they did, and also about the
tremendous power that seemed to be wrapped up in
one of those not very large hides. Hugh had seen
wolves pull down cattle, and had a great respect for
the way in which these animals were able to supply
themselves with food.</p>

<p>"You know more about big wolves, son, than most
men do," said Hugh. "You've picked up what we
can all see on the prairie here; and, besides that, you've
had a tame wolf of your own. I reckon that you
found, after you got to know him well, that your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>wolf was just nothing but a big dog&mdash;bigger and
stronger, and ten times more enduring, of course,
than any dog you ever saw, but still just pretty nearly
plain dog. Of course he and his father and grandfathers
for a good many generations had always
been wild dogs, but up to within a few generations
wolves were no more afraid of people&mdash;in this country,
I mean&mdash;than they were of any other animals.
You see in old times Indians never chased wolves,
or frightened them at all. They did kill some, but
they didn't kill 'em in a way to scare 'em. I reckon
I've told you already&mdash;if not I, the Blackfeet have
told you&mdash;about how the Indians used to catch
wolves in old times. If the Blackfeet haven't described
it to you, you surely must have had some
stories told you that explained how they caught 'em."</p>

<p>"Why, yes, Hugh," Jack replied, "I remember one
such story; but I never thought to ask much about
how they caught wolves&mdash;they spoke about setting
snares around the <i>pis'kun</i> and catching the wolves in
this way, but I didn't ask much about it."</p>

<p>"That's just what they used to do. You see, there
were always holes left in the <i>pis'kun</i> walls, mostly
small holes, and through these holes the wolves and
coyotes used to go into the <i>pis'kun</i> to feed on the
carcasses or the offal that was left there after the
butchering. Well, the people liked wolf skins: they
used them for robes, or for hats, or to cut up into
wide strips to sew on the edges of a buffalo robe
to make it look nice; and so around these holes they
used to set loops of sinew with a running knot. When
the wolf was squeezing through a hole he would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>put his head through one of these nooses and, drawing
it up, would choke to death in no time at all.
Catching wolves in this way didn't scare 'em and they
were always very tame."</p>

<p>"But, Hugh, I should think that after a while
all the wolves in a certain section of the country would
have been killed off."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," declared Hugh. "Wolves were
great travelers and used to follow the buffalo around,
especially in winter. When buffalo were plenty they
really didn't have to do any hunting to amount to
anything; they would just wait around the edge of
the herd. Animals were constantly getting hurt&mdash;bulls
were fighting; calves getting trampled on; buffalo
of all sizes were getting drowned when crossing
the stream, or being mired down in some soap hole.
I tell you, the wolves lived fat in those days, especially
along the Missouri River. Mr. Sturgis told me
one time about reading in the book that Lewis and
Clark wrote, telling the story of their trip up the Missouri
River, that about one buffalo pound they came
to, wolves were so plenty and so gentle that one of
the men killed one with a kind of spear that they
carried. The wolf let the man walk right up to him."</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember that story," said Jack. "I remember
it because the book says that the man killed
the wolf with an espontoon. I didn't know what
that was, and it took me quite a little time to find out.
It seems it's a kind of halberd&mdash;a sort of cross between
a spear and an ax. Anyhow, it had a long
handle."</p>

<p>"Well, of course," commented Hugh, "when a
man can get close enough to an animal to stick a
spear into it, the animal isn't what you'd call shy."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>
<p>"I should say not," answered Jack.</p>

<p>"Well," Hugh said, "I was talking about the wolf
being a big dog. You know, I reckon, that wolves
and dogs will cross."</p>

<p>"Yes; I've read that in books a good many times;
and the books talk about Indian dogs being like wolves.
I remember the first day I came out to Swift Water,
the time that Uncle Will killed the bear, I saw a
coyote, and when I saw him, I thought it was an Indian
dog, and that there must be a camp of Indians
somewhere near."</p>

<p>"I remember," chuckled Hugh; "I remember that
day well. You certainly had a lot of excitement
that day, considering how old you were, and where
you came from."</p>

<p>"Didn't I! I tell you, those early days were mighty
exciting."</p>

<p>"More so than anything that's likely to happen
to you again out in this country," drawled Hugh.</p>

<p>"You were saying that the wolves were dogs; and
I know that's just what Swiftfoot always seemed to
be. He would get scared like a dog; when he was
pleased he would wag his tail and lay back his ears
and show his teeth like a dog; if I took him out in
the country and turned him loose, he hunted like a
dog; and finally, when he got lost and could not see
me, he became confused and lost his wits like a dog."</p>

<p>"Well, I've seen a lot of half-breed wolves, and if
these half-breeds get away, and become wild, they're
worse than the wolves themselves; they're a good
deal smarter, and it seems as if they were hungrier,
and they certainly have plenty of courage. I never
saw many of these half-breeds that had gone wild,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>but I do remember one bunch down near the Dismal
River, in Nebraska, that certainly made a lot of trouble.
Old Lute North killed a number of 'em, and
I got the story from him, and got it straight, and if
you'd care to hear it, I'll tell it to you."</p>

<p>"Sure, Hugh, I'd give anything to hear it."</p>

<p>"Well," said Hugh, "this is what Captain North
told me. It didn't happen so very long ago. It
seems that one fall Major Frank North brought up
to the ranch at the head of the Dismal River a big
mongrel dog that some one in Columbus had given
him. The dog was big and black, that's about all
you could say about him. His hair was longish&mdash;not
so long as that of a Newfoundland, but a good
deal longer than that of a Great Dane. In fact, he
looked as if he might be a cross between those two
breeds.</p>

<p>"About the middle of that winter this dog went
off from the ranch one night with a big gray wolf,
and the next morning Lute followed their tracks in
the snow for several miles, but could not find them.
The dog was never seen again, and Lute always believed
that the wolves killed him, for he saw places in
the snow on the trail where the dog and a wolf had
fought.</p>

<p>"Next spring, Al Pratt, one of the cow punchers
at the Cody and North ranch, saw an old she-wolf
traveling and seven puppies following her. Four of
these puppies were black, and three were gray. Al
chased the wolves and managed to get close enough
to them to kill two of the black ones. All through
the summer the others were seen now and then, but
nobody could get near enough to get a shot at them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>That fall Bill Burke, another puncher, shot and killed
one of the gray puppies, and that winter a trapper
poisoned the other gray ones. The only ones of the
family now left were the mother and two black
puppies, but they were a fearful trouble on the range.
They would kill stock of all kinds. They were just
as ready to take a steer as a calf, and Lute told me
that one time he found where they'd killed a cow,
a two-year-old and a yearling in one day. They were
very shy and always on the lookout, and they seemed
never to go back to the animal that they had killed
for a second meal, so it was impossible to poison
them. Lute said, too, that there was a band of six
or eight coyotes traveling around behind 'em, and that
after the wolves had eaten all they wanted when
they killed, then the coyotes had their chance.</p>

<p>"Lute told me that he hunted those wolves a
good many days; and, of course, bein' out riding
all the time, and all the time on the lookout, and bein'
the kind of a shot he is, it seemed pretty sure that
finally he would get 'em.</p>

<p>"When he did get his shot, it was just by accident.
He was hunting a big black-tail deer, creeping along
the ground and trying to get within shot, when he
saw one of the black half-breeds standing on a sand-hill
nearly a mile away. He watched him, and after
a time the wolf lay down. Then Lute began to hunt
him, and I expect he did some mighty careful hunting.
Anyhow, he told me it took him a couple of
hours to get to the foot of the hill they were on. The
hill was steep, and you may guess something about
what it is to climb one of those steep hills in that
sand. I reckon Lute was about out of wind when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>he stopped to get his breath. He stood looking toward
the top of the hill, when the old mother wolf,
who was lying in a sand blow-out, raised up and
stood with her fore feet on the bank looking down
at him.</p>

<p>"There wasn't any time to think, and he jerked
his rifle to his shoulder and fired, and she disappeared.
He scrambled up the hill as fast as he could, and when
he got to where he could look over, he could see the
two black wolves going down the side of the hill.
They were jumping up on their hind legs and looking
back for their mother.</p>

<p>"As soon as Lute came in sight they began to run,
and he shot at one of them just as they were passing
out of sight. A moment later one of them came
in sight again and Lute shot at him. That fellow
kept running for perhaps a quarter of a mile, and
then settled down into a walk, and Lute knew that
he was hit. He sat and watched until the wolf disappeared
in some low sand-hills, and then went back
to the blow-out where he had seen the old wolf, and
there she was. This hole was about three feet deep
and it was all Lute could do to lift her out. He
said she was the biggest wolf he'd ever seen. He
now got his horse and went after the wounded one.
Finally he found him, and after running him a couple
of miles killed him. The other black one was never
seen again after that, and it's probable that Lute
killed him with his second shot.</p>

<p>"Lute told me that he counted something like
seventy head of cattle that he knew they had killed
that one winter. When Lute killed the old mother
and the black fellows, that bunch of coyotes was close
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>to them. He saw them run away from the hill. The
black wolf looked just about like a wolf, with a sharp
nose and sharp ears. He measured seven feet from
the tip of his nose to the tip of his tail."</p>

<p>"That's one of the most interesting stories I've
ever heard, Hugh; and people who don't know anything
about animals, I expect, would hardly believe
it."</p>

<p>"That's so," said Hugh. "When you're talking
to people about something that they don't know anything
about, they're likely to think that you're stringing
'em. You see most of us measure up everything
we hear by what we've seen, or what we've heard
and believe to be true; and when we hear anything
outside of that little narrow range, we're mighty
likely to think that people are lying to us."</p>

<p>"Of course, that's so," Jack assented. "I know
sometimes back East I've told about common everyday
things that happened here, and the people I was
talking to thought at first that I was just inventing
stories. Have you seen a great many of these half-breed
wolves? I mean crossed between a dog and
big wolves, not coyotes?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hugh; "in my time I've seen quite
a number; but most of 'em had been brought up at
home with their mothers. They were always timid
and afraid of strangers, but they never did any particular
harm around the house, except maybe to kill
chickens, or something like that. Of course, a wolf&mdash;or
a dog either, for the matter of that&mdash;always
likes to hunt; and if anything runs, it's bound to
chase it. You recollect, I reckon, some tame coyotes
that Charley Powell had one while several years ago,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>and don't you remember that he had to kill one of
them because it got into the way of killing his chickens?"</p>

<p>"That's so," answered Jack; "I remember that
now. But I never heard that those big wolves he
and Bessie had ever did any harm."</p>

<p>"No," replied Hugh, "neither did I."</p>

<p>Tulare Joe, who had been sitting by listening to
this talk, now asked a question.</p>

<p>"Mr. Johnson, have you ever seen any black wolves
in this country?"</p>

<p>"Not in this country; but way farther south I saw
one once; and down there they have red wolves, as
you've probably seen yourself. I saw black wolf
skins out on the Coast."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Joe, "down in Texas I've seen red
wolves myself, but it didn't look to me as if they were
as big as these gray wolves that we have up in this
country. Anyhow, down in the southern country most
of the animals like those we have up here seem much
smaller: the deer are smaller, and it seems to me that
the wolves and the antelope don't run so large. The
jack-rabbits, though, are bigger; but then they're not
just like our jack-rabbits up here&mdash;they're some different."</p>

<p>By this time the fire was burning low and the boys
were leaving it to spread down their beds at different
points on the prairie. The discussion of wolves was
given up. Hugh smoked a last pipe, and presently
they all went to bed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br /><br />

<small><small>A BAD MAN</small></small></h2>


<p>As Jack and Joe and three or four of the older men
lounged around the fire a night or two after that,
most of the younger boys having gone to their blankets,
McIntyre turned to Hugh.</p>

<p>"Who do you suppose I saw to-day on the range?"
he asked.</p>

<p>Hugh looked up inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Claib Wood."</p>

<p>"What's he doing here?" asked Hugh. "I
thought he'd been run out of the country and had
gone to stay."</p>

<p>"Oh, well," said McIntyre, "that's what most of
us thought, I guess. He got a warning from the
people around here and from the stock association
that he'd do well to get out of the country; but I met
him to-day, and he said 'Howdy' to me as chirk as
you please. I didn't have any talk with him, and
I watched him kind o' close, for I didn't know what
he might be up to. He never turned his head, though,
after he passed; just rode on across country, and I
saw him going for a mile or two before he got behind
a hill."</p>

<p>"Well," drawled Hugh, "I reckon that this time
he's not after calves. Maybe he's come down here to
go in to the railroad and see if he can't get some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>money out of that wife of his. Since he quit home
about a year ago, she's been doing well, and has got
quite a nice little eating-house there in town. Maybe
he's heard about that and has come back to make
her give up to him."</p>

<p>"If that's what he's after," said McIntyre, "it's
an infernal shame. I never had any use for these
bad men that we used to have in the country, but
I do wish now that somebody a little worse than Claib
would come along and kill him off."</p>

<p>When Hugh and McIntyre had begun talking, Jack
Mason was lying on the ground close to the fire, seemingly
asleep, but presently he opened his eyes and then
rose to his elbow and listened intently. After a time
he asked McIntyre if this was the Claib Wood who
four or five years ago used to be around Rawlins.</p>

<p>"Yes," said McIntyre; "he's the man&mdash;little,
sawed-off fellow with light brown hair and a brown
mustache; good cow hand and mighty quick with a
gun."</p>

<p>"I reckon that's the man," returned Mason.</p>

<p>He said nothing more for a little while. Jack was
about to ask some question about the man, when
Mason spoke again.</p>

<p>"I used to know Claib, but I haven't seen him for
a good many years. Which way did you say he was
going, Mac?"</p>

<p>"Well," answered McIntyre, "when I saw him he
was just riding across the prairie, but from the way
he was headed I judged that he was going in to the
railroad."</p>

<p>"What time was it you passed him?"</p>

<p>"About two or three o'clock this afternoon. If he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>was going to town and rode fast, he'll be there by this
time."</p>

<p>"Yes," Mason said, "so he will."</p>

<p>For a little while nothing more was said, and then
Mason changed the subject.</p>

<p>"Mac, I guess you'll have to give me my time,"
he said. "I've got to go into town. I can't say sure
when I'll be back, and I reckon maybe I'd better
quit."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you?" asked McIntyre,
severely. "Ain't you satisfied? Ain't you bein' well
treated? Anything wrong with the pay?"</p>

<p>"No; nothing wrong with the pay, nothing wrong
with the treatment. Only it just struck me that I've
got some business to attend to in town, and I reckon
I'd better do it now than wait until the round-up's
over."</p>

<p>"I hate to lose you, Jack," McIntyre said. "Can't
you go in and attend to your business and then come
back? Take two or three days off. The town ain't
so big but what you can do everything you're likely
to have to do in the course of twenty-four or forty-eight
hours."</p>

<p>"Well," Mason replied, "maybe that's better. I'd
like it better, if it suits you; only it don't seem just
right for a man to take time off right in the middle
of the round-up, just to go into town after his own
affairs. So I thought, as I've got to go, maybe you'd
rather have me quit for good. Still, if you'll let me
take three or four days off, it'll be lots handier for
me. I'll leave my horses here with the bunch, and
then come back when I get through."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>
<p>"All right," agreed McIntyre. "Do it your own
way."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Mason. "I may as well start now,
and then I'll get into town by daylight."</p>

<p>He rose from the fire and presently his cheery
whistle was heard coming over the prairie from the
direction of the horse herd, and a little later the men
in the camp who were just dropping off to sleep
heard him throw the saddle on the horse and draw
the latigos, and then came the sound of hoofs, trotting
off over the prairie and growing fainter and fainter
in the distance.</p>

<p>All night long Mason rode through the dark, under
the clear stars. It was nearly twenty miles to
the wagon road, and after he had reached that, it was
more than twenty miles in to the railroad, but the
sun had not long risen when he trotted his tired horse
down the straggling street of the forlorn little town.
As yet there was hardly a sign of life there. Two
or three pigs were rooting in piles of rubbish not far
from the road; and a starved-looking cayuse stood
humped up at the end of a picket-rope on a bit of
prairie where once there had been grass but which
now was as bare as the palm of Mason's hand.</p>

<p>As Mason trotted along the street, the door of a
house opened, and a man came out carrying a bucket.
Mason drew up his horse.</p>

<p>"Hello! Ross," he called.</p>

<p>"Why, hello! Jack," the man replied. "What are
you doing down here? I haven't seen you for a dog's
age. Four or five years, isn't it, since you were up
in Rawlins?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>
<p>"Five years," said Mason; "and since then I've
been away, up North, and now I've drifted back again."</p>

<p>The two shook hands, and began to exchange news
and experiences, each telling the other more or less
of what had happened to him since they last parted.</p>

<p>"Well," said Ross, "how long are you going to
be in town? I want to see you before you go."</p>

<p>"I don't just know how long I'm going to be here;
maybe for a day or two. I've got some business I
want to attend to here, and as soon as I get through
with that I'm liable to move out again. There ain't
much to hold me in this burgh."</p>

<p>"No," agreed Ross. "If I had any sort of a job
in the open I'd tackle that. By the way," he added,
"did you know that Claib Wood was in town?
Seems to me your brother and Claib had some trouble
at Rawlins that winter we were all there."</p>

<p>Mason laughed.</p>

<p>"Sure they had some trouble; and just after it
occurred Claib skipped. I never had a chance to
speak to him about it. I heard the other day that
he was in the country, but I didn't know that he was
here in town."</p>

<p>"He is," said Ross; "and if I were you I'd look
out for him. Claib was drunk last night, and you
know when he's drunk he's awful mean, and he certainly
is quick with a gun."</p>

<p>"So I always heard. He's quick with a gun, and
he's mean; meaner, I expect, when he's drunk, but
mean enough at any time. Now when he shot my
brother in Rawlins, they hadn't had any words, or
any quarrel. Rufe told me when he got well that he
never did know why Claib shot him, and I always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>made up my mind that if I ever saw Claib I'd ask
him."</p>

<p>"Well, Jack," cautioned Ross, "if I were you I
wouldn't do that. I wouldn't have any words with
Claib Wood. You're too good a man to quarrel with
him, because if you do quarrel with him, you'll be
liable to get killed quick."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't expect that it's time yet for me to
pass in my checks; but if I stay in town for twenty-four
hours, and Claib is here, I can't help running up
against him somewhere, and I reckon he won't forget
whose brother I am."</p>

<p>"No," said Ross; "he won't; that's a sure thing.
I'd like to have you avoid him, if you can. Of
course, you can't leave town because he's here, and
you can't hide because he's here; but I do hope you
won't quarrel with him, for he's mighty mean and
mighty quick."</p>

<p>"I'll have to do the best I can," replied Mason.
"I don't want to get killed, and I don't want to have
to kill anybody. See you later, Ross."</p>

<p>He swung into the saddle, and fifty yards farther
on turned into the livery barn where he unsaddled
his horse, watered it, tied it in a stall and gave it
some hay.</p>

<p>At the little eating-place where he went for breakfast
he had to wait a long time before anything was
cooked, but about the middle of the morning he went
back to Ross's house, where he had a pleasant and
long talk with him, renewing old times. It was
nearly noon when he went up the street again and
entered the saloon. Half a dozen men were there.
One or two were sitting at card-tables poring over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>old newspapers; two were playing a game of cards;
and one was standing in front of the counter talking
to the bar-tender. A glass of liquor which
seemed just to have been filled rested on the counter
directly in front of him. The man standing there
was Claib Wood. Mason walked quietly into the
room without receiving more than a casual glance
from any one there, and was standing close to the
counter before Wood saw him.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm darned, if this ain't Jack Mason!"
Wood exclaimed. "Where did you come from?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I've been cutting little circles over the prairie
between here and the British line for five years now,
Claib," Mason answered; "ever since the last time I
saw you in Rawlins, just before you shot Rufe. I
always wanted to ask you about that. How did you
come to shoot him? You didn't have any quarrel
with him, so far as I heard."</p>

<p>"Say, now, what's the matter with you, Jack?"
exclaimed Claib. "Are you looking for some of the
medicine that Rufe got?"</p>

<p>Mason laughed merrily.</p>

<p>"Not a bit, Claib. I'm not looking for anything,
without it's a little information. Of course I've
heard of bad men that would shoot a fellow down
just for meanness; but I never saw one, and I was
wondering if you were that kind of man. I was
wondering, for example, if I were to turn around and
walk to the door here, whether you would plug me
before I got there? Now, I don't know anybody
who can tell me about that as well as you."</p>

<p>Claib's eyes were bloodshot from his excesses of
the night before, and as Mason talked to him an ugly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>light seemed to glow in them and the sneer of his
face grew more pronounced. The two men were
standing face to face rather close together. Claib's
right hand and Mason's left hand toward the bar.</p>

<p>"See here, Jack," said Wood, "it looks to me like
you're hunting for trouble and trying to pick a quarrel
with me, and I don't want nothing of the kind. I
come in here to attend to my own business, and I
reckon you'd better clear out and attend to yours,
if you've got any."</p>

<p>"Sure, I've got some," replied Mason; "but when
I saw you in here, I thought we could have a little
friendly talk, and maybe you'd tell me why it was that
you shot Rufe in Rawlins. As I say, I never could
hear that you had any quarrel."</p>

<p>"Well," said Claib&mdash;and his hand with a swiftness
that the eye could hardly follow, flew around
to his hip; but it never reached the butt of his pistol;
for Mason with lightning speed shot forward his
left hand and caught Claib by the wrist, while with
his right hand he seized the glass of liquor resting
on the bar and dashed it into Claib's face. Then he
wrapped both arms around him, and called to Ross
who had just stepped into the door.</p>

<p>"Take this man's gun and mine and keep them!
This isn't going to be a shooting-match."</p>

<p>Ross snatched both pistols from their holsters and
stood back.</p>

<p>For a moment the men whirled around over the
bare floor in a rapid dance, and then Mason suddenly
lifted Claib off the floor, held him for an instant
in the air above his head, and then threw
him an astonishing distance. The man's head and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>shoulder coming in contact with the plastered wall
burst a large hole in it and loosened some of the weather-boarding
on the outside of the building.</p>

<p>Several of the men hastened to Wood and picked
him up, expecting to find that his neck was broken.
He was senseless and on feeling him they found that
his right arm and right collar-bone were broken and
the shoulder out of place. None seemed to feel much
sympathy for him; he was too well known.</p>

<p>"Now," said Jim Decker, the proprietor of the
hotel, "who's going to pay that man's doctor's bills,
and who's going to pay for that plaster that you've
knocked off, Jack Mason?"</p>

<p>"Why," returned Mason, smiling, "there isn't any
doctor in town, so there can't be any doctor's bills;
and as for that plaster, if you'll take one of those old
newspapers and tack it over the hole, that'll do fine
until cold weather comes. When cold weather comes,
I'd put a board over it, if I were you."</p>

<p>"Well," snorted Decker, "that's a great note!
Coming in and breaking up a man's furniture this
way!"</p>

<p>Mason laughed.</p>

<p>"Charge it up to expenses," he said; "that's just
one of the incidental expenses of running a saloon."</p>

<p>Decker slouched away behind the counter,
grumbling to himself.</p>

<p>By this time, applications of cold water had
brought Wood to his senses, but he was more or less
dazed and confused. Jack Mason went over and
spoke to him.</p>

<p>"Claib, you've got some broken bones now, and
you'll have to lie quiet for a while. There isn't any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>doctor in town, but I reckon Ross and me can fix
you up so you'll be all right, if there's a place for
you to stay. Have you got any money?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I've got money enough. But what's the
matter with you? Didn't you just start a quarrel
with me? And now I've got knocked out. Do you
want to mend me up again?"</p>

<p>"That's what," said Mason; "mend you up; and
then if I ever have trouble with you again, I won't
stop at breaking your arm and collar-bone. I'll break
your neck and make it a sure thing that you won't
trouble this country any more; but don't let's talk
about it now."</p>

<p>Three or four of the men carried Wood to the
bedroom on the top floor of the hotel, and Mason and
Ross, with the help of the station-agent, managed
to set his arm in very good shape, to put the shoulder
in place and to bind the arm so that they would
presumably do well. Then Jack Mason had a long
talk with Ross and the proprietor and made arrangements
for them to look after Wood until the railroad
company's surgeon could be got hold of.</p>

<p>During the afternoon, Claib had a good deal of
fever, and at times was delirious. Ross sat up with
him during part of the night and was relieved by
Mason, and in the morning the patient was much better
and quite rational.</p>

<p>About the middle of the morning Mason came into
the room, where Claib was alone.</p>

<p>"Well, Claib," he said, "I see you're better and I
reckon now that you'll get along all right. It won't
take long for your bones to knit. I'm going off now,
but I thought I'd come in and have a little talk with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>you before I left. You're a pretty mean man, and
you're pretty quick with your gun, and a pretty good
cowboy. After you shot Rufe in Rawlins I always
made up my mind that I'd have a talk with you if we
ever met up together, and now I've had it. You're
mean, and I expect that when you get well maybe you'll
try to get me; but if I were you I wouldn't do it.
You're quick, but it isn't any ways likely that you're
the quickest man in the world, or even in Wyoming,
or even in Medicine Bow. You tried to draw yesterday,
but you weren't quick enough. You may lay
for me and get me in that way sometime, but if we
ever meet and you try any of your tricks with me,
I'm more likely to get you than you are to get me;
and I believe it would be a good idea for you to remember
that. I don't want to kill you, but if I have
to I will.</p>

<p>"Now I've been to see your wife this morning
and I've told her that you're laid up, and she says
she's willing to take care of you until you're able to
get around. You won't be able to move for a week
or two now, and I told her she had better leave you
here and just kind o' keep track of you, and see
that you're comfortable, and not try to take you to
her house. She's a good woman, Claib, and if you
were smart you'd be good to her."</p>

<p>Claib made no reply to Mason's rather long speech,
but his eyes glittered with anger. As Mason turned
to go out of the room, Claib glared at him savagely.</p>

<p>"I'll git you yet, Jack Mason!" he cried.</p>

<p>"Better think it over, Claib," Mason called back
cheerily.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br /><br />

<small><small>AN ENGLISHMAN IN CAMP</small></small></h2>


<p>As Mason stepped out of the saloon, turning up the
street toward the stable, he saw Ross walking toward
him with a tall, large, red-headed young man,
who was evidently an Englishman. As they met,
Mason spoke.</p>

<p>"I'm going to start back now, Ross. I've finished
up my business here in town."</p>

<p>"Hold on a minute," said Ross. "Here's a man
just come in on the passenger this morning, who
wants to go out into the country where you're going,
and I told him maybe you could help him. Mr. Donald,
this is Jack Mason."</p>

<p>"If I can help you, Mr. Donald, I'll be glad to,"
Mason said as the two shook hands; "but I'm just
going back to the round-up camp, forty miles or so
from here."</p>

<p>"Well," explained the young man, "I was thinking
of going out to Mr. Sturgis's ranch. He lives
somewhere up North, about forty miles, I think he
told me, from the railroad. Is his place anywhere
near your camp?"</p>

<p>"No; but there are two or three of his men along
with our outfit, and if you want to come out there
with me, some one of them may be going over to
his place before long, and could take you there. It's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>a perfectly plain road from here out to the ranch,
just as soon as a man knows the road, but if he
doesn't know it, he's liable to get lost a good many
times before he gets there."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ross, "I told Donald that it was a
plain road out to the Sturgis ranch, but that there
were about twenty roads turning off from it, and it
wouldn't be easy to take the right one."</p>

<p>"Have you got a horse to ride?" asked Mason.</p>

<p>"No," answered Donald, "I have no horse; but I
was going to buy a horse and saddle, or perhaps two
horses, here in town. Mr. Ross says that he has
one that he would either sell or hire, and that he thinks
he could find another that I could use as a pack
horse."</p>

<p>"Are you used to the saddle?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I have ridden a little."</p>

<p>"Let's go back to my house," said Ross, "and sit
down and talk it over, and I can soon find out what
we can do about horses."</p>

<p>As they walked back up the street, Ross turned to
Mason.</p>

<p>"So you've finished up all your business, have you,
Jack?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; I'm ready to pull my freight as soon as I
can put the saddle on my horse."</p>

<p>"Well," commented Ross, with a little twinkle of
his eye, "it seems to me you got through pretty
quick."</p>

<p>"So, so," drawled Mason. "It didn't take me
long after I once got at it."</p>

<p>"Well," said Ross, "I don't want to quarrel with
you, Jack Mason; but you look to me like the biggest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>fool that I've seen since I come into Wyoming Territory."</p>

<p>Mason laughed heartily.</p>

<p>"Come on, come on, Ross," he said. "What's your
riddle? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Why," Ross answered, "I believe you didn't
come into this town for a single thing except to
find Claib Wood and break him all up, when the
chances were all in his favor that he'd kill you before
you could bat an eye."</p>

<p>"Oh, come, Ross," said Mason; "you're doing a lot
of guessing. Didn't I tell you when I first came into
town that I didn't know that Claib Wood was here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you did say that, but I'll bet you a new
suit of clothes that if you didn't know he was here,
you felt mighty sure that he was; and that if you
hadn't felt sure you wouldn't have come to town."</p>

<p>"If I had an imagination like yours, Ross," laughed
Mason, "and could use a pen a little better than I
can, I'd have made a fortune long ago writing for
the newspapers."</p>

<p>"Oh, come off, Jack," returned Ross. "I've
known you too long. Don't give me any guff of that
kind."</p>

<p>They reached the door of Ross's house, and Mason
changed the subject.</p>

<p>"I understand that you've got a horse and saddle
for Mr. Donald. Is that so?"</p>

<p>"Right," answered Ross.</p>

<p>"Then, suppose you take him around and see if
you can get a pack horse and saddle on any terms
that'll suit him, and come back here. I'll go up and
saddle the two horses, and we can put Mr. Donald's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>bed on the one you get; then roll, and get to camp
to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>The preparations for the journey did not take long,
and the sun was yet two or three hours high when
Mason and the young Englishman trotted off over
the dry prairie. Mason led the pack horse and Donald
rode behind, to urge it on in case this should be
necessary, but it went so very well that before long,
its hackamore was tied up, and it trotted swiftly on
behind or beside Jack Mason's horse, though Donald
still rode behind it as a precautionary measure.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock at night they reached the point
where the road must be left to go across the prairie
to the camp. Here they stopped and removed the
saddles from the horses, allowing them to roll and to
eat a bite of grass. Then they saddled and started
off again; and it was getting light when Mason pointed
out to Donald the white wagon covers of the camp,
and the cattle that dotted the hillsides not far from it.
Mason had told Donald that he would better turn his
animals into the cávaya the next day, in order that
they might rest, and had suggested that he himself
might like to ride in the bed wagon and sleep
during the day, but the Englishman very quietly said
that he thought he would go along with some part
of the outfit, if he had a horse which he could ride.</p>

<p>As the new arrivals sat by the fire, waiting for
the announcement of breakfast, the sleepy cowboys
rose one by one from their beds, and after dousing
their heads and arms in cold water, gathered around
the fire. Breakfast was soon over, and just as the
men were saddling up, Jack Danvers and Vicente,
who had been on the last relief of the night herd,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>came trotting into camp. Jack was introduced to
Donald, who told him he was headed for Swift Water
Ranch when he could get there, and the two young
men shook hands cordially.</p>

<p>"I have been out in this western country two or
three times," said Donald, "but this is the first time
I have stopped in a cow camp. It must be very interesting
and full of excitement, I should think."</p>

<p>"Well," said Jack, "that depends on what you
call excitement. I can tell you it is full of hard work;
and just about as soon as the bloom of novelty has
worn off, hard work is all you see of it. I can remember
when I was a little fellow that I used to
think it would be the greatest fun in the world to
have a string of horses and ride around wearing
shaps and clinking spurs, and maybe with a silver
saddle-horn; but I have seen too much of it to care
for it greatly now. How is it with you, Joe?" he
asked, turning to Tulare Joe, who stood rolling a
cigarette by the fire, with his horse's bridle rein over
his arm.</p>

<p>"Well, Jack, I guess you've been through some
school and have learned some lesson. Cow punching
is awful good fun to read about, but reading is
the best part of it. Books don't ever tell you how
thick the dust is, nor how dry you get, nor how sore
you become from riding, nor how mean a horse or a
cow or a steer can be. No, the books leave out all
that sort of thing."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Donald," said Jack, "you are going
along with us for a few days until you get a chance
to go over to Uncle Will's, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Donald; "that is what I should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>like to do. But if I am going to stay in the camp,
I should like to be of some use. I don't want to
just ride a horse up and down and nothing else. I'd
like to earn my grub, if I do nothing more."</p>

<p>"Mason says you have no horses to ride," said
Jack; "and, of course, on a round-up a man cannot
do much without horses."</p>

<p>"No," admitted Donald; "but I was wondering
whether I could not hire three or four horses&mdash;say
one from each of four or five men, so that I could
really do some riding. I would enjoy the experience;
and, while I do not know anything about the work,
I fancy I could learn. Of course, I am more or
less used to the saddle."</p>

<p>"Of course you could learn," replied Jack. "It
is just riding and being able to put your string on
an animal when you need to."</p>

<p>"There is where I am weak," Donald said. "I
know nothing about roping. Of course, if a horse is
walking in a corral I can put a noose over his head;
but as for standing off and throwing it far, I cannot
do that."</p>

<p>"That's easy to learn," explained Joe, as he threw
down the end of the brand with which he had lighted
his cigarette. "Any of us could teach you all you
have to know about that in a mighty short while."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do to-day?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>"Why, Mason said that he would lend me a horse
out of his string for the day, as both of mine traveled
all night, and I thought I would ride along either
with the cattle herd or the horse bunch, and use my
eyes as much as I could."</p>

<p>"That's a good idea," said Jack. "Now Joe and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>I are going out with the cattle herd to-day, and if
you want to come with us, you can see something,
and I think you can learn something too."</p>

<p>"Ripping," was Donald's answer.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll go over and see Mason and find out
what horse he wants you to ride and then we'll get
started; but, hold on, here's Mason now;" and a
moment later Mason rode up to the fire and handed
to Donald the rope that was about the neck of a
small but beautiful bay horse.</p>

<p>"Have you fixed on what you're going to do, Donald?"
he asked; and Donald told him what they had
decided on.</p>

<p>"That's bully," said Mason. "I'm riding with the
herd to-day, so we'll be together again."</p>

<p>As they rode off toward the herd, Donald turned
to Jack.</p>

<p>"It seems to me that Mason is a great man," he
said.</p>

<p>"How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Why, all last night as we rode along he was singing
and whistling and making jokes, and telling funny
stories. Three or four times I nearly fell off my
horse from laughing at him; and yet the day before
that, according to the story, he beat up a man in town
so that he will have to be in bed for six weeks."</p>

<p>"Beat up a man!" exclaimed Jack. "That
couldn't have been Mason."</p>

<p>"Why," said Donald, in some confusion, "I hope
it is not a secret. Everybody in town was talking
about it. I was only there a few hours, and five or
six men spoke to me about it. It seems that a man
there tried to draw his gun on Mason, and Mason
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>was too quick for him. He picked him up and threw
him pretty nearly through the side of the house and
almost broke his neck."</p>

<p>"Great Cæsar's ghost!" exclaimed Jack. "That
will be news to everybody in this camp."</p>

<p>"Hold on," said Donald; "I wish you would not
say anything about it until somebody else does. I do
not want to be carrying gossip around from one place
to another; but, as I told you, it was the only thing
that they were talking about in town day before yesterday.
I fancy it is the most exciting thing that has
happened there for a long time."</p>

<p>"Yes," assented Jack, "I guess it's quiet enough
there most of the time; but say, what was the name
of this man that Mason got into a quarrel with?"</p>

<p>"I cannot remember what the full name was, but
almost everybody spoke of him as 'Claib.' I do
not know any such name as that, but I suppose it may
be a nickname."</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" cried Jack; "why that must be
Claib Wood! They say he is one of the worst men
in the country&mdash;a regular killer. He was ordered
away from here because he was suspected of cattle
stealing&mdash;and they say that there is hardly anybody
in the country as quick with a gun as he is."</p>

<p>"Well, he was not quick enough for Mason, it
seems," said Donald. "I asked one of the men in
the saloon how it happened, and he said it was so
quick he really did not know how it did happen. He
said that the two men seized hold of each other, and
that Mason called out to somebody to take away both
guns, that there was not to be a shooting-match; and
then a minute or two later Mason lifted up Claib and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>threw him against the side of the house and through
the plaster and almost out through the boards. I saw
the place and it certainly did look as if something
very heavy had been thrown against the wall."</p>

<p>"I'd like to know just what happened," said Jack;
"but one could not very well ask Mason; and I suppose
we will have to wait until somebody comes out
from town to tell us the news."</p>

<p>"If you don't mind, I'd rather not have you say
anything about what I have told you, to any one here,
for, as I say, I do not want to be carrying tales."</p>

<p>"All right," promised Jack; "I'll keep quiet. But
say, it seems to me that this thing is one of the biggest
jokes that ever was. I think a lot of Mason and
it seems to me that he was in great danger if he was
quarreling with Claib Wood; but you seem to have
brought him back perfectly well and sound."</p>

<p>The young Englishman grinned.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I brought him back."</p>

<p>All day long the men kept with the herd, and all
day long the young Englishman was practising throwing
the rope, so that toward evening he had a good
idea of how to handle it, though oftener than not
he missed the object at which he was throwing. At
the same time he was learning the eccentricities of the
rope, and a little more practise was likely to make
him reasonably skilful. All the boys insisted that
practise, practise, practise was the only way in which
he could become expert, and Donald determined that
he would devote much time to this work for the next
two or three days.</p>

<p>That night at the fire, Jack, with a grave face, and
having warned Donald to be careful, began to ply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>Hugh and McIntyre with questions about Claib Wood,
asking how bad he was, whether he had killed many
men, and other pointed and pertinent questions. He
seemed most anxious for all possible particulars as
to Claib Wood.</p>

<p>All the time he was watching Jack Mason, who,
sitting by the fire with an awl and a piece of buckskin
string, was mending a pair of ripped shoes.
Mason, however, gave not the slightest evidence of
interest in the conversation, and at last Jack was
obliged to abandon his examination of the two older
men, feeling that he had wholly failed in his efforts
to make Mason respond.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br /><br />

<small><small>A LESSON IN ROPING</small></small></h2>


<p>The next day was devoted to cutting cattle and
branding calves, and Jack told Donald that this was his
chance to practise roping. Jack very hospitably,
since Donald was to be the guest of his uncle, gave
him his own rope which was in excellent condition,
and provided himself with a second one, which had
been used only a few times and so was somewhat
hard and stiff. Donald was much interested in the
work, and anxious to see how it was done, and Jack
promised that, so far as he could, he would look
after him, and coach him in the work of catching
calves.</p>

<p>"But you'll have to look out for yourself and do
the best you can," he added, "for there is no time
for school-work on the round-up. Very likely you'll
make lots of breaks, and the fellows will make lots
of fun of you; but that you'll have to stand. They're
all good-natured, but everybody that makes a mistake
or blunder gets laughed at in a cow camp. It
isn't likely that you'll be able to catch calves by their
feet. What you'd better do for a starter is to try
and catch 'em by their necks, and not throw 'em, but
just sort of lead and drag 'em over to where the boys
are."</p>

<p>"All right," agreed Donald; "I suppose that's the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>best thing that I can do. I don't understand this
business of catching animals by their feet, and you'll
have to tell me about that, before long. I'll try to
catch them by the neck, and lead them over; but
I haven't a great deal of confidence that I'll do much
with it."</p>

<p>The men who were cutting that morning were
Charley Powell, Jack Danvers and Jack Mason. Before
long it happened that Jack drove a cow and calf
over toward the Sturgis bunch, and as Donald was
nearby Jack beckoned to him.</p>

<p>"Put your rope on the calf and lead it over to
the fire," he called as Donald rode up.</p>

<p>Donald made ready to catch the calf and, though
a little slow, he made a good throw before the calf
was near the bunch; but unfortunately the loop was
so large that the calf jumped through it and was following
its mother into the Sturgis herd when Jack,
shaking with laughter, threw his rope, caught the
calf by the feet and started it for the fire. Donald,
much mortified, slowly gathered up his rope and overtook
Jack before he had reached the fire.</p>

<p>"That must have seemed a pretty stupid thing to
you, but what was the matter?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why," explained Jack, "your loop was too big,
and the beast ran through it. If you had had experience
enough you would have seen that your loop
was too big, and that it was going beyond the calf's
head, and by jerking up your throwing hand you
could have stopped the loop so that it would have
fallen just over the calf's head, and it would have
run against the noose with its chest and been caught.
Usually you can get right close to a calf and then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>throw with a small loop and a rather short rope;
but, as I tell you, this is all a matter of practise."</p>

<p>"I am going to watch you," said Donald, "and
the next time you cut a calf out, I will try it over
again."</p>

<p>"That's right," declared Jack. "If you stay with
it you will certainly get there."</p>

<p>But Donald had to learn the lessons of experience.
With the next calf that he tried to rope he did better,
but, being unable to control his rope properly,
the calf's head and forefeet went through the loop.
He threw up his hand too late and caught the beast
around the middle, and it gave as lively an exhibition
of bucking as a three-month-old calf could furnish.
The cow had gone on into the bunch and Jack was
watching her, and, fearing lest she should turn about
and come out to fight, he put his string over the
calf's head and led and dragged it to the fire while
Donald meekly followed at the other end of his
rope.</p>

<p>The boys at the fire shrieked with laughter when
they saw what had happened, and declared that they
would not cast the rope loose; while Donald did not
know how to free it.</p>

<p>"Just put that rope under the iron here, and we'll
mark it for keeps," one boy shouted.</p>

<p>Donald made no response except to smile and shake
his head. He took it all very good-naturedly, and
when his rope was turned loose gathered it up and
again helped Jack drive the calf to the bunch.</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Jack. "You are improving;
but you have got to keep on practising. It does
not take one day nor one year to make a man a good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>roper. Now I am no roper myself, and yet I have
been doing it pretty nearly every summer for the
last five or six years."</p>

<p>Donald's third trial was successful. He rode up
pretty near to the calf and threw with a short rope
and, catching the beast, he turned his horse and
dragged the calf up to the fire. When he got there
he was received by the boys with more laughter and
louder shouts than before. They declared that this
could not be Donald; that it must be some one else
disguised to resemble him, for it was perfectly well
known that Donald never caught calves except around
the middle.</p>

<p>Jack, however, was greatly delighted with his new
friend's success, and congratulated him warmly on the
progress that he was making.</p>

<p>All through the morning they worked hard and
all were glad when dinner time came and there was
a chance for a little rest. Most of the men saddled
fresh horses and those holding the herds were relieved
and had an opportunity to get something to
eat. Jack and Donald were sent out to hold the
Sturgis bunch, and while they were out there, and a
little later when they pushed the cattle off to one
side to feed, Donald asked Jack to tell him something
more about the art of roping.</p>

<p>"You men here catch your calves by the feet, and
I've heard," said Donald, "that there are men who
can catch any foot of a running animal, if you ask
them to. That seems perfectly impossible to me; and
in fact it seems to me impossible that anybody could
catch the feet of a running animal, but of course
I've seen it done to-day."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes," replied Jack, "it is done all the time. It
is easy enough to catch an animal by his fore feet,
or his hind feet, or by one fore foot or one hind foot,
but I am not enough of a roper, and I don't believe
I ever shall be, to pick up any foot when I am asked
to."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't expect you to tell me how to do
things that you say you cannot do yourself, but I
would like to understand how to catch an animal by
the feet."</p>

<p>Jack laughed.</p>

<p>"Why, that's like most other things in the world:
awful simple when you know how to do it, or even
how it is done. You just throw your rope so that
the animal steps into it either with his hind feet
or with his fore feet, as the case may be, but you've
got to pull your rope just at the right time. That
is to say, if the beast puts his fore feet into the
noose lying on the ground, and you leave the noose
lying there, why the critter won't get caught. You've
got to give a lift and pull on your rope just at the
right moment."</p>

<p>"That seems simple enough," declared Donald; "or
at least it seems as if it would be simple enough to
a man who knows how to rope."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jack, "but it takes some judgment.
You've got to put your rope in the right place, and
then, as I said, you've got to pull on it at the right
time. You may see boys catching animals by any
foot before we get through this round-up, and it is
constantly done on the prairie with horses that are
mean. If you want to learn how to rope, and to
see roping well done, you'd better watch Vicente, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>Tulare Joe, who was raised in California with the
Mexicans there. He handles a rope better than anybody
else in the camp, except Vicente and Juan who
are Mexicans. As for Charley Powell and Jack
Mason and myself, we are just plain ordinary ropers
that can catch horses and cows most of the time but
can't do any fancy tricks with a rope the way those
Mexicans can. I've seen one or two Mexicans do
things with a rope that made my eyes stick out about
a foot; but some Americans are pretty good. They
tell of a man down on the plains&mdash;in Nebraska, I
believe&mdash;who once when roping calves in a corral,
caught and took to the fire a hundred and ten calves
in a hundred and ten throws. He didn't miss a
single throw."</p>

<p>"I should like to see something of that kind; but
for the present I guess plain roping will occupy my
attention. There is another thing I want to ask you.
Are the Indians good ropers?"</p>

</div>




<p>"Fair," answered Jack, "but nothing to brag of&mdash;nothing
great. They do as well as any of us
ordinary cowboys. There is an interesting thing about
that&mdash;something that Hugh once told me&mdash;that a
good many years ago, when Hugh first came into the
country&mdash;that was in 1849&mdash;the Indians could
hardly rope at all. All the same they used to catch
lots of wild horses by just running them down. The
country then was full of wild horses. In the spring
when the wild horses were poor and weak, the Indians
used to take their best horses and start out and
find a bunch of the wild horses and chase them as
hard as they could, and finally catch them. But they
did not know how to rope them. They used to make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>big hoops of willows and tie the noose of the rope to
such a hoop with small strings; then when they had
run down an animal, so that they could ride up alongside
of it, they would pass the hoop over its head
and pull back on the rope; the strings which tied
it to the hoop would break, the noose would run up,
and the animal could be choked down.</p>

<p>"Of course, they could never catch good horses;
those that they got were mostly colts or mares heavy
with foal, and animals that were particularly weak
from lack of food and the winter's cold.</p>

<p>"The Indians that I've seen did not appear to me
to handle their horses very well, and they have no
more feeling for a horse than they have for a saddle
or a travois. They never consider that a horse has
any feelings: it is simply a tool to help them get about
and to bear burdens. The Indians are really kind-hearted,
but my notion is they just don't happen to
think of the suffering they may cause the horse. Indians
are kind to each other and to their friends, but
I don't think you could call them kind to animals."</p>

<p>"I suppose that is a matter of education," suggested
Donald.</p>

<p>"I suppose so," answered Jack. "Besides that,
when you are all the time struggling with an animal,
or a lot of animals, and trying to make them do
something that you want them to do, and that they
don't understand, you get kind o' mad at them because
they don't mind you. You forget that they
don't understand, and you are likely to be brutal to
them. Now, for example, I was thinking to-day that
it would be a good idea for you, after you get to
know how to use a rope a little better, to practise on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>some of these cows, catching them and throwing them,
but I don't suppose a cow very much enjoys being
thrown, and it is a question which is the more important,
for you to have practise in throwing cows,
or to spare the cow the grief of being thrown. I
don't suppose it is very pleasant for an animal running
at full speed to be checked up and made to turn
a somersault and hit the ground like a thousand of&mdash;beef
we'll say."</p>

<p>"No," Donald said slowly; "I guess not; and I
think the question you have suggested is rather a
nice one."</p>

<p>"Well, we needn't worry about that. There will
be plenty of chances for you to practise on cows before
long; and meantime you've got to learn to
catch calves."</p>

<p>The boys had an idle, easy time watching this
bunch of cattle which was constantly being added to
by animals cut out from the big bunch. Before evening
all the cattle had been separated and Jack and
Donald rode back to the camp together.</p>

<p>Supper over, the boys sat about the fire lazily smoking
and talking. After a while there was a pause,
which was presently broken by McIntyre.</p>

<p>"I met one of the boys from the Bar Lazy A to-day
when I was riding. He was going back to the
ranch. Said he had been sent in with a message and
spent a day or two in town. I asked him if he had
seen anything of Claib Wood, and he said yes, he
met him a couple of nights ago; that Claib was full,
and looked as if he were hunting trouble. Then he
said the next day they had quite a little excitement
in town&mdash;let's see, Mason, that must have been about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>the time you were there. Did you hear of any excitement?"</p>

<p>Mason had looked up quickly when McIntyre began
to speak and then lowered his eyes and was looking
at the fire.</p>

<p>"Why, no, Mac," he replied; "I didn't see anything
that excited me very much. The town seemed
about as usual&mdash;dogs lying in the sun, asleep; two
or three men reading a month-old newspaper; lots of
flies buzzing in the windows; passenger comes in once
a day going east, once a day going west, and freight
trains happen along occasionally. Not much excitement
in town."</p>

<p>At this answer, the usually grave McIntyre slapped
his thigh and burst into a loud guffaw.</p>

<p>"Bully for you, Jack Mason!" he cried. "You've
got some sense of humor, darned if you ain't. Why,
boys," he went on, addressing the group, "this is
what Red Casey of the Bar Lazy A told me. He
said that the other morning&mdash;meaning the morning
Jack Mason here got to town&mdash;he was settin' in
Jim Decker's saloon playin' a little game of poker with
Slim Jim Rutherford, when Jack here come into the
saloon. Claib Wood had been drunk all the night before,
and had just come in for his morning nip. Jack
here walked up to him and they talked for two or
three minutes and then Claib tried to draw his gun.
In a jiffy Jack grabbed him and held him and called
to Ross to take both guns away; and then after a
minute Jack picked Claib up and threw him across
the room so hard that when he hit the wall and fell
on the floor his arm and collar-bone were broken, and
his shoulder was out of joint. Claib hit the wall so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>hard that the boys thought he was dead; but it seems
not, and it's a darned pity too. Now, Jack Mason,
why didn't you tell us all this when you came back
from town?"</p>

<p>The boys shouted with laughter, but Mason said
nothing&mdash;only continued to look at the fire.</p>

<p>When the tumult of cheers and jokes had somewhat
died down, McIntyre repeated his question, but without
receiving an answer. Then he turned and looked
over toward Donald.</p>

<p>"Say, boys, there's another criminal here, it seems
to me. Here's this Britisher that came out the other
night with Jack Mason. He must have known all
about the thing, and I would like to know why he
didn't tell us. He's tryin' to learn how to be a cowboy,
but he sure will never learn to be a good cowboy
until he's ready to give the news, and to make
fun of any other puncher that he gets a chance to
josh."</p>

<p>After a moment, Donald spoke.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. McIntyre, I am new at the cowboy
business," he said. "I have only been trying to learn
it for a day or two, and so I cannot be expected to
do my work very well. I did tell one boy when I
got here, and it made him laugh so much that I got
a little scared and asked him not to say anything
about it until the news reached the boys in some other
way. Isn't that so, Jack Danvers?"</p>

<p>"Sure," vouched Jack. "Donald told me the
whole story the morning he got in, and I wanted to
make a whoop and hurrah about it right off, but he
begged me not to, because he didn't want to be counted
a gossip. Don't you remember last night, when I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>was asking you men all those questions about Claib
Wood? I was watching Jack Mason all the time
to see if he would make any sign, but he never let
on that he had even seen Claib Wood when he was
in town."</p>

<p>This speech of Jack's called forth a series of yells
of delight from the little company. Many jokes were
made; and Jack Mason, becoming somewhat embarrassed,
finally rose and went to his blankets. The
other boys soon afterward dispersed to their beds.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br /><br />

<small><small>DRIFTING</small></small></h2>


<p>The next night Jack, Vicente and Tulare Joe went
out on night herd for the second relief. It was very
dark, the sky was pitchy black and the wind blew now
and then in swift gusts.</p>

<p>"It's a mean night," Joe said as they rode along,
"and I wouldn't be surprised if we had trouble with
the cattle."</p>

<p>"It sure looks as if it were going to storm," Jack
agreed; "and nobody can tell just what that will
mean."</p>

<p>When they reached the herd, the men whom they
were to relieve declared that so far the cattle were all
right, but feared that the threatening storm would
start them moving. Some of them decided that they
would stay with the cattle until the storm broke, or
passed over. "It's going to storm," they said, "and
there's no use in going back to camp and getting into
our blankets, only to be called out again in a few
minutes." There was thus a double guard, and the
men followed each other at shorter intervals than
usual, singing, talking and calling, in the effort to
give the cattle, which as yet were quiet, the confidence
which so often seems to come from the proximity
of a human being.</p>

<p>Presently it began to rain a little, and the wind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>blew harder, and in fierce gusts, with lulls between
them. During such lulls, the wind could be heard
coming far off, and in the blasts of wind the men
to the windward of the cattle could not hear the sounds
made by those to leeward.</p>

<p>By this time the cattle had begun to rise to their
feet and to walk about, bawling. Then some of them,
singly or by twos and threes, started out from the
main bunch to walk away to leeward, only to be turned
back by the men who came across them. Then, little
by little, the whole bunch began to move along, but
still only at a walk.</p>

<p>Jack spoke to Vicente in what he thought was a
loud tone of voice, but the wind snatched his words
away and Vicente, putting his hand up to his ear,
leaned over toward Jack, who repeated his question.</p>

<p>"Shall we try to hold them, or just let them drift,
and stay with them?"</p>

<p>"Must let 'em drift," shouted Vicente, "but keep
'em together. Pretty soon some boys from camp will
come. Must let 'em drift until storm stops, or they
get shelter. The best thing is for three of us to get
ahead, and go slow with the wind, and one man get
on each side."</p>

<p>Jack rode off to speak to such other men as he
could find, and presently from up the wind came the
sound of galloping hoofs, which then slowed down to
a trot, and in a little while almost the whole force of
the camp except the cook and the night horse wrangler
were about the herd, moving along at the same pace
with it, guarding it carefully in front and carefully on
either side, and leaving the rear of the herd open.</p>

<p>The wind blew with the violence of a tornado and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>the occasional spits of level rain which accompanied
the storm stung the face. One or two men who had
been slow about tying on their hats lost them with
little prospect of ever recovering them. The cattle
were uncomfortable and moved along bellowing, but
showed no disposition to run. On the sides they
sometimes tried to scatter, but the line of boys riding
there kept them turned back.</p>

<p>This went on for some hours, until Jack thought
that daylight must be near. His slicker was on his
saddle, but at no time had it seemed to rain hard
enough to justify his stopping and putting it on, for
at every moment there had seemed either something
to be done, or a possibility that quick action might
be required; so by this time he was pretty wet and
pretty cold, but he thought little of this in his anxious
watching of the cattle. Presently, however, he happened
to turn his eyes upward, and saw three or four
bright stars looking down at him from the sky, and
he gave a whoop of joy for he knew that the storm
had about blown itself out. Soon the wind began
to fall and then the eastern horizon to lighten, and
before very long the bright sun rose in a clear sky, and
their troubles for the time were over.</p>

<p>The weary cowboys turned the herd and drove the
cattle back over the trail they had followed, until they
reached their old bed ground. There they turned
them loose under the charge of two or three men,
and all the others returned to camp for breakfast,
which, as a matter of fact, was now dinner, for it
was high noon.</p>

<p>"Boys," said McIntyre while they were eating their
meal, "we may as well stop here now and rest up;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>but, Jack and Joe and Donald, as soon as you've eaten,
you three go out and relieve those fellows on herd,
and let them come in and get some dinner. After
these boys have slept two or three hours, I will send
men out to relieve you."</p>

<p>The cattle, like the cow punchers, were tired, and
as soon as they had grazed a while they lay down,
showing no disposition to move. The boys, therefore,
took a commanding position on a hill and holding
the ropes of their horses allowed them to feed
about them.</p>

<p>"Of course, that was not a stampede, Joe?" asked
Donald uncertainly.</p>

<p>"Not much," said Joe. "That was just plain ordinary
drifting; but there was one while, just before
the cattle started, when I thought that it was nip and
tuck whether we would have a stampede or not. It
would not have taken much to start those cattle off,
and it sure would have been a bad night to ride in
front of 'em and to turn 'em."</p>

<p>"I don't see how a man could ride fast over such
a country as we crossed," Donald said.</p>

<p>"Well," said Jack, "could, or could not, he'd just
have had to. It's a ground-hog case when a stampede
is on."</p>

<p>"But I should think you'd break your neck; and
kill all your horses."</p>

<p>"Well," declared Joe, "sometimes a man falls and
breaks his neck, and oftener still a horse falls and
breaks his neck or a leg, but of course the cattle have
got to be turned. That's what we're hired for, and
it's our business to do our work."</p>

<p>"You spoke before about turning the cattle.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>Where do you want to turn them to, and why do you
want to turn them?"</p>

<p>"We want to turn 'em to get 'em to mill, and if
we once get 'em milling, the trouble is pretty well
over."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to seem so dull," said Donald, "but
what do you mean by milling?"</p>

<p>"Why, we want to turn the cattle and get 'em
running around in a circle. The hind ones will follow
the lead ones, and if you can turn the lead ones,
and keep 'em turning, after awhile they just keep
running around and around in a circle and the hind
ones follow 'em, and as you can understand, they
don't get very far away."</p>

<p>"Now, certainly," exclaimed the Englishman,
"that is very clever. I never should have thought
of that. But how do you manage to turn them? Of
course, you cannot go in front of them, because they
would run over you and kill you."</p>

<p>"You do go in front of 'em; and without you go
in front of 'em, you surely can't turn 'em. What
a puncher does is to get right up even with the head
of the herd and maybe a little in front of it, and
then to keep edging over so as to push the head of
the herd away from him. Likely too he's got to
make some gun play, because, of course, the flash
and noise of the shots close to 'em will tend to push
the cattle over. Sometimes men go right in front
of 'em and try to stop 'em by shooting, but I never
saw much good done in that way.</p>

<p>"I reckon if you ask Vicente, or any of the older
men here&mdash;McIntyre, for example&mdash;he'll tell you
that it counts for more to try to push the cattle over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>from one side than it does to go in front of 'em and
try to stop 'em. If you do that they may turn; but
what's just as likely to happen is that they'll split
and go off in two or three bunches&mdash;and that's likely
to mean that the whole country has got to be ridden
again to gather up these scattered cattle."</p>

<p>"It must require an extraordinary amount of
courage on a black night such as last night to ride
in front of, or even up at the head of, a herd of
frightened cattle going as hard as they can," said
Donald. "I am sure that I could not have ridden
fast last night and guided my horse at all. I could
not see my horse's ears, to say nothing of the ground
in front of him."</p>

<p>"No," Jack said; "I guess you couldn't. I've
never been yet in a real stampede, but I'd be willing
to bet that the cow puncher who rode at the head
of a stampede and tried to look out and guide his horse
on to good ground would not be worth very much
a month to his employer. How is that, Joe?"</p>

<p>Joe laughed.</p>

<p>"I guess he'd be worth about seventy-five cents a
month; and he'd have to furnish his own grub, too."</p>

<p>"But what do you mean?" asked Donald.</p>

<p>"Why," explained Joe, "a man riding fast and
at night don't try to pick his ground&mdash;he can't try
to pick the ground. He leaves that to his horse; it's
up to him to watch the cattle, and it's up to the horse
to keep on his four legs. If the rider doesn't watch
the cattle and the horse doesn't keep on his legs, why
horse and rider both are out of it, and of no use to
anybody."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's just what I supposed," said Jack. "I remember
once a good many years ago Hugh gave me
a lecture on horses, and the use they make of their
eyes; he told me about how many falls young stock
have before they are broken, and how much use
horses must make of their eyes. You can see that
if you put a blind on a horse, he will stand perfectly
still, no matter how wild he is, and will let you do
'most anything with him. Take the use of his eyes
away from him, and a horse is pretty nearly afraid
to move."</p>

<p>"Sure thing," declared Joe, as he scratched a
match to light a cigarette that he had just finished
rolling; "a prairie or a mountain horse can go along in
the dark without anybody guiding him a great deal
better than he could if driven by the sharpest-sighted
man."</p>

<p>"Donald might like to see it, but I hope with all
my heart that we won't have a stampede on this
round-up," Jack said.</p>

<p>"I hope not," replied Joe. "I have known of one
man being killed and several men being hurt in stampedes,
and if I can keep out of 'em I mean to do
it. Now, look here, if one of you fellows will lend
me his watch I'll set here and look after these cattle
for an hour, and you two can go to sleep; then, after
an hour, I'll call one of you and sleep myself, and
an hour later he can call the other. By that time
likely there'll be somebody out to relieve us."</p>

<p>"No," protested Donald; "you and Jack sleep, and
let me watch. I have done less work than any one
since I came here, and I can sit on this hill in the
sun and see what the cattle are doing. If they make
any movement I can call one of you."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>
<p>"All right," assented Joe; "that'll suit me, if you
feel like it."</p>

<p>Jack and Joe stretched themselves out on the ground
and with their hats over their faces were soon breathing
heavily in deep sleep. Donald sat on the hill and
watched the cattle, but as time passed he grew more
and more sleepy until finally he had almost made up
his mind to stretch out and close his eyes&mdash;not really
to sleep but just to think. However, as he looked
at his watch just before this desire became overpowering,
he saw that only ten minutes remained of his
vigil, and so kept himself awake until it was time to
call one of the others.</p>

<p>Joe on being roused shook himself, rose and walked
a few yards back and forth in either direction and
then, thoroughly awake, sat down and began to roll
and smoke cigarettes.</p>

<p>Before the time came to call Jack, Mason and Charley
Powell appeared on the scene, saying that they would
stay with the cattle until it was time to bed them
down. The other three gladly mounted their horses,
trotted into camp and threw themselves on the ground
in the shade, where they slept until the cook shouted
the call for supper.</p>

<p>After the meal was over Jack sat down by the
fire close to the Mexican.</p>

<p>"Vicente," he said, "I was mighty glad I bumped
up against you last night, for I had no idea what
had to be done. Of course, when I recognized your
horse I knew that you could tell me."</p>

<p>"Yes," drawled Vicente between puffs of his
cigarette, "last night, most had cattle running, what
you say <i>estampeda</i>. Pretty lucky the other men got
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>there. If once those cattle had started, we'd have
had to ride hard."</p>

<p>"There was one while," said Jack Mason, "that
I was plumb lost. I was riding that little whittley-dig
pony of mine, and he stepped in a hole and fell
down and I rolled off. It was so black I couldn't see
anything. Reaching around I happened to feel the
horse. I mounted, but I was all turned around. I
didn't have an idea which way the cattle were, and
I couldn't see nor hear 'em. Of course I knew the
only thing to do was to let my horse find the cattle;
and that's what he did; but until I got close to 'em
I didn't know where they were, nor anything about
'em."</p>

<p>"Mighty queer," commented Hugh, who was listening,
"the way a man can get turned around, if he
can't use his eyes. I reckon I've told you, son," he
added, turning to Jack, "about the only time I ever
got lost. It was on pretty nearly level ground that
I had never been on before, and in a blinding snowstorm.
Well, sir, I had no more idea of the direction
of the sun, moon or stars than just nothing at all.
For a little way I traveled by the wind, and then I
stopped and made up my mind that I'd wait until
something happened; and I did have to wait for
twenty-four long hours before I got a glimpse of the
sun."</p>

<p>"I had something like that happen to me once in
thick timber that had been burned over," Jack Mason
said. "It was a cloudy day on a kind of plateau,
and every tall straight stick looked like every other
tall straight stick. A mighty mean situation to be
in."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>
<p>"It must be a terrible sensation," said Donald, "to
lose all sense of direction. Long ago, before I had
ever been much out of doors, I used to carry a compass
and to consult it frequently, but of late years
I have rather abandoned that practise."</p>

<p>"When the sky is clear you don't need a compass
or anything else," said Jack, "because you can
look at the sun or the stars; but, of course, if it's
cloudy, or rainy, or snowy, that's different. If a
man is in a country he knows, or knows anything
about, and gets lost he can follow the ravines and
creeks down to the main stream."</p>

<p>"Well," put in Hugh, "a man isn't in much danger
of being lost just as long as he keeps his wits about
him; but just as soon as he gets scared and loses his
wits and begins to think that the sun is in the wrong
place, or the compass is wrong, or the waters are
running uphill, then he's in a bad way, because he's
pretty close to crazy. The main thing is to keep your
head, and then you'll come out all right; but in
these days, when there are so many fences and roads
and railroads all over the country it would be pretty
hard to be lost, I expect."</p>

<p>"Yet back East," said Jack, "every now and then
we hear about men and women and children being
lost in little pieces of swamp and woods almost within
hearing of their houses. Of course, these are people
who have never thought of taking care of themselves
out of doors, and get lost just as soon as they
get where they can't see things that they recognize."</p>

<p>"Such people ought not to be allowed to wander
away," drawled Jack Mason; "they ought to have
people to look after them. But then I suppose back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>East there are so many houses and so many people
that it's hard to get out of sight of 'em."</p>

<p>"No," laughed Jack; "there are a good many people
there, but it isn't quite so bad as you say."</p>

<p>Hugh knocked the ashes from his pipe, rose to his
feet, and stretched.</p>

<p>"Well, good night, boys; I'm going to hunt my
blankets," he said.</p>

<p>The others soon followed him and the fire was
deserted.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br /><br />

<small><small>A STAMPEDE</small></small></h2>


<p>Jack was destined to be disappointed in his hope that
he would not see a real stampede.</p>

<p>Toward evening of the very next day the sky
clouded over in the late afternoon and there was a
little rain. Night fell damp and drizzly, but there
was nothing to lead any one to believe that there
would be trouble. Jack went on night herd with the
last relief, and with him rode Charley Powell, Donald
and Mason. The herd was quiet, and the boys whom
they relieved started back to camp, while the four
who had come out began to ride about the cattle at
a walk. For an hour or more the quiet continued,
and there was no warning of any excitement.</p>

<p>Half asleep, Jack was riding along, when suddenly
from the bed ground came a drumming of hoofs and
a rattling of horns, constantly growing louder, and
Jack knew that the whole herd were rushing directly
toward him. In an instant, everything that he had
ever heard about stampedes flashed through his
memory, and he knew that the first thing he must do
would be to get out of the way of the rushing cattle,
and then that he must stay with the leaders.</p>

<p>The mind works quickly in such a case, and the
horse, which often knows as much about handling
cattle as the rider, is ready to do the right thing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>With the first sound of the rushing herd, Jack's legs
closed on his horse and it felt the spurs, and a short
dash to one side took horse and rider out of the
path of the dense mass of cattle which swept close
behind them. Automatically, as it seemed, the horse
turned and kept along with the bunch. Jack remembered
that for a little while it was useless to try
to do anything except keep up; he must wait until
the cattle had become strung out, the swiftest ones
leading and the others following. To try to turn
the closely packed herd as it started would be hopeless.
The only thing to do was to let them get well strung
out, and then to ride up close to the leaders and
push them over to one side.</p>

<p>In a short time Jack could tell from the sound that
most of the bunch was behind him. He began to
swing over to his left, so as to get close to the leaders.
He thought that they must have run a mile.</p>

<p>Pushing up to the leaders, and constantly riding
closer to them, he shouted and began to shoot his
pistol, and as he drew nearer he was gratified to
know that the cattle were crowding away from him.
He was right with the leading animals. It was pitch
dark and nothing could be seen, but the sound of the
pounding hoofs, the clatter of horns as they struck
against one another, and the puffing and snorting,
told him that he was close among them.</p>

<p>Suddenly and without warning, Jack's horse turned
a somersault. Jack flew a long way, and alighted on
his back with a thump that almost knocked the breath
out of him. Almost as he hit the ground, he heard
his horse scramble to his feet and gallop off. He
had no time to think about whether he had his breath
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>or not, or whether his horse were lost. He was
thinking of the cattle that were following the leaders
he had just left, and realizing that in a few moments
the whole bunch might run over him. He ran
a few steps in the hope that he could get away, climbed
a little bank and began to shout, to fire his gun and
to shake the skirts of his slicker. He could hear
cattle passing on both sides of him. Every now and
then one would come near enough to be seen as a
dim shadow; and as the animal saw the dancing,
shouting man it would give a loud snort and jump sidewise,
while Jack would jump the other way, sometimes
almost in front of another animal which perhaps
would snort and make a sweep of its horns or turn
and kick at him. For a little while Jack had more
excitement than had ever been compressed into a like
space of time in his experience. He had no opportunity
to think much of the danger, or to get frightened.
All he could think about was to make all the
noise he could, and to frighten away from himself
the already terrified cattle.</p>

<p>Presently the rush of the cattle ceased. Jack reloaded
his six-shooter, and then had time to collect
his wits and to begin to wonder what had happened.
He had seen nothing to make the cattle start, and did
not know why they had done so. He had little or
no idea why his horse had fallen, but when he began
to move about, it was apparent that the animal had
run into a shallow gulch which it had not seen, and
thus had tripped. It was lucky for Jack that he had
not tried to stick to the horse after it was evident
that it must fall, but had let go and tried to get away
from it. It was lucky also that he had clung to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>six-shooter, for without doubt the shots that he fired
after he was afoot had helped to turn the cattle from
him.</p>

<p>Jack knew that it could not be far to camp, but his
tumble and the excitement of the last few minutes
had caused him wholly to lose his sense of direction.
He knew that the only thing for him to do was to
stay where he was until daylight broke, and then to
make his way back to camp on foot. As soon as he
could see, and so get his bearings, there would be no
trouble in finding camp, where he could get a fresh
horse; and as soon as day came the boys would of
course start out to find the cattle.</p>

<p>It was still drizzling. Jack walked about a little to
find some place to sit down and presently stumbled
over an elevation which his hand told him was an
ant-hill&mdash;one of those heaps of coarse sand a foot
and a half or two feet high, which the ants throw
up in high country. On this Jack sat down, for the
ants would not be stirring until the hill had dried off,
and he knew that it would not dry until the sun came
up. Oddly enough he did not feel stiff or sore, and
he concluded he must have landed on some big clump
of brush which had broken his fall.</p>

<p>He sat there a few minutes, meditating on what
had happened, when presently very faintly he heard
the hoof-beats of a slowly jogging horse, which was
drawing nearer and nearer.</p>

<p>"I wonder," thought Jack, "if that's my horse
going back to camp? It would be great if I could
catch him and ride in. The cattle are gone, and they
can't be found until day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>The hoof-beats drew nearer and nearer, and presently
seemed to be passing Jack, not very far off. He
hurried toward the sound, calling out as he did so:</p>

<p>"Whoa, lad! Whoa, lad!"</p>

<p>"Hello, who's that?" came Donald's voice.</p>

<p>"Come over here, Donald," called Jack. "My
horse fell with me and has gone off, and I'm waiting
here for daylight to come to get back to camp.
Where have you been?"</p>

<p>"Why," explained Donald, "I tried to follow those
cattle, but they all ran away from me; and now I'm
trying to get to camp, but my horse don't want to&mdash;he
seems to want to follow the cattle."</p>

<p>"Well, I've had more excitement here in the last
half-hour than any man is entitled to. When my
horse fell I thought that whole bunch of cattle was
going to run over me, and I've been jumping around
here as hard as I could, trying to keep them off."</p>

<p>"I hope you didn't get hurt when your horse fell
with you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Jack, "I must have hit a soft spot. I'm
all right, but I'd like to get back to camp, so as to
start out with the boys when it gets light, and try to
find the cattle."</p>

<p>"I want to find camp, too," replied Donald; "but
I don't know whether I can. My horse doesn't seem
to want to go that way."</p>

<p>"Do you know in which direction camp is?"</p>

<p>"Yes; it's off that way," Donald answered, pointing.</p>

<p>"I'm all turned around," admitted Jack, "and I
don't know where the camp is; but I'll tell you what
I'd do if I wanted to go to camp&mdash;I'd put my reins
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>down on my horse's neck and let him go in the direction
he wants to go. The chances are that he
knows where camp is a great deal better than any of
the rest of us."</p>

<p>"That may be true," replied Donald; "but suppose,
on the other hand, he takes me off four or five
miles farther away; what then?"</p>

<p>"Well, if you're not willing to trust him, get down,
and if we can find my ant-hill again we can sit there
until day comes. It certainly can't be very far off."
Jack looked around the horizon. "I believe that's
day coming now," he said, pointing to a place where
the sky seemed a little lighter than elsewhere. "If
it is, we won't have long to wait before getting our
direction."</p>

<p>Donald dismounted, and they sat there on the
ground waiting. Presently the light grew, and it
was now certain that this was the dawn; so the east
was found and the points of the compass were located.
Gradually it grew light. As soon as they
could see a short distance, the boys started back to
the camp, Jack walking over the damp ground, of
which he picked up a few pounds on his shoes and
spurs, so that at short intervals he was obliged to
stop and clean off the mud. By this time, however,
it had stopped raining, and the soil began to dry.
Presently, when it was good daylight, though before
the sun had risen, they met half a dozen men from
the camp, starting out to look for the cattle.</p>

<p>McIntyre heard Jack's story with a broad grin; but
he frowned as he thought of the cattle scattered, no
one knew where.</p>

<p>"Did you see anything of Jack Mason?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No," answered Jack; "nothing. Two or three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>times as I was pushing in to turn the cattle, I thought
I heard somebody yell behind me, but I could not be
sure, for I was making all the noise I could myself."</p>

<p>"Well," said McIntyre, as he turned his horse, "go
in and get something to eat and fresh horses, and
then come on. It may take us a long time to gather
those cattle, or maybe Mason has 'em wound up somewhere
now."</p>

<p>The cowboys rode off, and Jack and Donald were
soon in camp eating breakfast. Jack's slicker in his
fall had been split from neck to skirt and until mended
would be useless. Hugh, who with the cook and
horse wrangler had remained in the camp, saw it, and
told Jack to leave it with him, and he would sew up
the tear. "It won't be of much use," he commented,
"in real rainy weather, but it'll keep you dry in a
drizzle."</p>

<p>Hugh had smiled at Jack's story of his attempts
to dodge the stampeding cattle, and had told him
that he was mighty lucky to have got off as he did.</p>

<p>A little later, Jack and Donald, mounted on fresh
horses, rode out to take the trail of the stampeded cattle,
but they had gone only a short distance, when
from the top of a hill they saw, far off, a bunch of
cattle coming.</p>

<p>One of the first men they saw when they met the
herd was Jack Mason, and the two young men rode
up beside him to ask an account of his adventures,
and to relate their own.</p>

<p>"I was following along not far behind you, Jack,"
said Mason. "You were advertising your place by
shooting and hollering, and I was trying hard to get
up to you, to try to help push over the lead cattle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>and get 'em turned. All of a sudden, though, your
light seemed to go out. There were no more shots
and no more yells, and I made up my mind something
had happened to put you out of business. Before
very long I got up to the leaders and managed
to crowd 'em over and over until at last I got 'em running
in a circle, and then before long, of course, the
circle got smaller and smaller until they all got packed
together and then they had to stop. They didn't get
very far beyond where you left 'em, not more than
a mile and a half, I should think, and I didn't have
any trouble holding 'em there until daylight; and soon
after that the boys came up, and here we are again.
But what happened to you? I suppose your horse
fell, because he was with the cattle when day come.
One of the boys has got him there now."</p>

<p>Jack told again of his fall, and as before the
story was laughed at and he was congratulated on his
escape.</p>

<p>"Well," said McIntyre, as the party got into camp,
"we seem to be anchored to this place. We'd better
move to-day. You boys go out and ride a short
circle and we'll camp to-night over on Sand Creek."</p>

<p>That night in camp the talk was all of stampedes;
there was the usual speculation as to what caused
them, and all agreed that no one could tell why cattle
stampeded.</p>

<p>Jack Mason was asked whether anything had happened
to start the cattle, so far as he could see, and
both he and Donald declared that they knew of nothing
that could have alarmed the cattle.</p>

<p>"I saw something funny a number of years ago,
down on the prairie," said Hugh. "I was working
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>for Cody and North, on the Dismal River, and one
time when we were taking some beeves into town
south of the range, near Cottonwood Creek, these
beeves stampeded. It was a bright moonlight night,
and you could see quite a long way. I had been
riding around the beeves and had stopped my horse
and was sitting quiet on him, watching the cattle,
when, suddenly, a little off to one side, I saw an
antelope. He must have seen me about the same time
and have wondered what I was. He trotted up pretty
near me and then trotted away again, and made a
circle and came around near the cattle, and when he
got pretty close to 'em he whistled, and away the
beeves went. It didn't take 'em half a minute to get
started, and they were headed straight toward the
tent and the wagon. I crowded 'em off so that they
missed the wagon. They were not much frightened,
and ran only a little way. I suppose they were just
startled for a minute."</p>

<p>"I was in a beef stampede down there one time,"
said Tulare Joe. "These were big beeves, ready for
market and we were cutting 'em out to ship. That
was one of those black nights that you read about.
You couldn't see anything. We had the beeves bedded
down on the side of a sand-hill, one of those sand-hills
that's terraced off in little benches. I never knew
what started those cattle, but they started and came
down the hill toward me, and I went down the hill in
front of them, not knowing whether I'd get out alive
or not. The way their horns hit together sounded
like a company of cavalry firing their pistols. When
we got down on the flat, the cattle passed Jim Lawson
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>and me, and we chased 'em down the valley for several
miles, but finally we lost 'em all. Later we
gathered 'em&mdash;most of 'em at least. When we were
rounding up the country down on the middle Loup,
we kept finding these cattle for three or four days.
We got 'em to the railroad at last."</p>

<p>"There was another stampede, and a queer one,
at the Dismal Ranch," Hugh said. "A big bunch of
yearlings stampeded in a corral. I never understood
how it was, for I wasn't there when they started,
but was coming down toward the ranch. Of course
we had never thought of cattle stampeding in the corral,
and it happened that there were no horses up;
most of 'em were in a little pasture close to the house.
The corral was cut into four small pens and next to
the outside fence there was a gate in the wall of each
pen, opening into the next pen. These gates were
open, and you'd think that if the cattle had stampeded
in the corral they'd all have run around one way, but
instead of that these yearlings must have split in
two bodies, and one part run around the corral one
way, and one the other. Then they must have met
and piled up there, and the result was that they broke
out two panels of the fence&mdash;great strong cedar
posts and poles. Some of 'em went over the fence,
but most of 'em went through, and the fence was at
least seven feet high.</p>

<p>"I was going down to the ranch and was about a
mile away when I heard them start, and when I got
down to the corral they were just going over and
through the fence. I followed 'em, and Buck and
Bax Taylor came on as soon as they could get horses.
Those yearlings ran all night. Two or three times
we got 'em together and turned 'em until they'd stand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>still, and then they'd keep perfectly quiet. For about
fifteen minutes after they'd stopped they were so
quiet that you couldn't hear a sound; you couldn't
hear 'em breathe; and then they'd begin to step out
a little to get room, until they were pretty well spread
out. They'd stand still listening and not making a
move; and then, all of a sudden, off they'd go again.
We lost about a hundred out of the bunch, but got
'em later on another round-up. Several were killed
going over the fence, and two or three broke their
legs, and there was about a wagon load of horns on
the ground there."</p>

<p>"That antelope story of yours is a pretty good
one, Hugh, but I've got another," spoke up Tom
Smith. "I was on herd one bright moonlight night
and the cattle were all lying down. I'd been riding
about 'em and had stopped for a little time, and was
sitting still on my horse. I was about half asleep,
with my face to the cattle, and my horse must have
gone altogether asleep. He must have been asleep,
because he fell on his knees, and when he fell the
saddle-flaps squeaked. That started the cattle. They
jumped up and ran; but they didn't go far. I don't
think they really stampeded&mdash;they were just startled,
not scared."</p>

<p>"I reckon everybody was kind o' surprised that
time," chuckled Hugh.</p>

<p>"I know I was," admitted Tom.</p>

<p>"I don't call that stampede by the antelope, nor
the one Tom just spoke about, a real stampede," said
Joe; "but that stampede of the yearlings, and the
one we had last night, were sure enough the real thing."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hugh, "those yearlings were scared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>for keeps. That bunch had just come over the trail
from Texas, and the animals were tired and thin.
They'd just come in and hadn't been branded. I
never would have supposed that they could have
stampeded, but they were scared; and they were always
afraid of that corral. We never got that bunch
into that corral afterward. We had to rope most
of 'em out on the flat, and brand 'em that way. It
was awful slow work, and before we got through we
tried separating 'em into little bunches of forty or
fifty, and these little bunches we could get into the
corral."</p>

<p>"Wasn't it dark last night?" remarked Donald.
"I do not remember ever to have seen a blacker
night."</p>

<p>"I guess so," said Joe. "We've all of us been out
on some of those black nights when you just can't see
anything. Some nights maybe you think it's just as
dark as it can possibly get, and then all at once it gets
so much darker that you think it hadn't been at all dark
before. On some of those nights you can see the
electricity on your horse, a sort of blue light running
up from your horse's ears and then maybe a little
blue flame running down the back of his neck toward
your saddle. I never saw cattle run in that kind of
weather; though you'd think they would.</p>

<p>"I remember one night of that kind. We were
holding the cattle, but it was blowing and raining
some, and the herd was drifting along behind us, like
it did night before last. There were several of us in
front of the cattle; we could hear each other when
we called, but we couldn't see each other, nor anything
else. There was some lightning&mdash;very bright.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>I had just turned my horse to look back and try to
see by the lightning flashes if any of the cattle were
slipping by us and getting away, when all at once the
lightning struck right in the middle of the bunch.
There was about seventeen hundred head of 'em, and
for a second it was just like day and I saw the whole
bunch. I saw the bolt fall. It seemed to me that the
whole middle was knocked out of the herd. I thought
I saw two hundred head of cattle drop. They fell in
every direction. The cattle didn't run, but that lightning
killed seven head.</p>

<p>"After the storm had passed, we turned the cattle
and drove 'em back to a bed ground, close to where
they'd started from."</p>

<p>"Well, I've been handling cattle for a good while,"
said McIntyre, "and I've no idea what makes cattle
stampede. Anything may cause one, and then again
there are times when you couldn't stampede a bunch
if you tried."</p>

<small><small>COW HORSES AND THEIR WORK</small></small></h2>


<p>The next day they were cutting again. Donald was
active and tried to help, though he accomplished but
little because he lacked real knowledge of the work.
But if he did not himself do much, he at least saw
many things done.</p>

<p>Of these one of the most interesting was Vicente's
handling of a fighting steer. Charley Powell had cut
out and was trying to drive the animal, but it stopped
to fight. It would not move but stood and faced the
horse and rider. Presently Vicente came up and, after
a word or two with Charley, rode around behind the
steer while Charley ran his horse close by the animal's
head to try to make it charge. On his second
dash by it the steer put down its head and rushed
after the horse, but before it had made half a dozen
jumps Vicente's rope had passed over its horns. He
wound the rope around his saddle-horn and as he
drew the rein his horse set its forelegs and braced itself
in real picture-book fashion; the rope tightened
and the steer turned a somersault and slammed down
on the earth with tremendous force. Vicente sprang
from the saddle, leaving the little horse bearing back
with all its weight against the rope to hold the steer,
ran forward to the animal and in a moment, as it
seemed, had hog-tied it. It was then left on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>prairie to think the matter over, while Vicente and
Charley Powell went off to their work.</p>

<p>That night about the fire, Donald could not say
enough in praise of the work of the cow horses and
their seeming understanding of what was required of
them; and the others assented to his enthusiastic
declaration that a well-broken cow horse is interesting
to watch and shows great intelligence in doing its part
of the work of handling the cattle. Joe and Vicente,
however, said little, but at length in response to some
direct appeal Joe said:</p>

<p>"Well, boys, there's no denying that these horses
know a heap, and that some of 'em do their work
mighty well. I expect if it wasn't for the horses
there wouldn't be any cattle business; but honest, and
without wanting to blow off my country or any other
country, you ought to see the horses in the South,
whether it's southern California, or Texas. I think
maybe they're not always as strong as the mountain
horses up here, but they're a whole lot quicker.
What's more, it seems to me they understand their
work better and do it better; and if that's so, here's
one reason for it: The cattle down there are different&mdash;at
least they used to be in old times, and I reckon
they are yet. Most of you know what an old-fashioned
Texas long-horn is: mostly head, horns and
legs&mdash;light, quick on his feet, and a great hand to
dodge. Now those Texas horses, and the southern
California horses too, have been broke to handle these
cattle; and to be any good they've got to be fast,
quick to turn and ready to meet any move the steer
makes. Up here, you've got a great deal better class
of cattle: they're heavier and make better beef, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>that means that they're slower&mdash;more like barnyard
cattle. They don't handle themselves anything like
what those Texans do. Texas cattle put the horse
and his rider more on their mettle than these grade
cattle. They call for greater quickness and readiness;
and though I am a Wyoming cowboy now, I'm bound
to say that the best cow hands I've ever seen have been
down in the South and Southwest."</p>

<p>"I guess that's gospel," Hugh said. "I saw something
of the cattle business down on the plains when
the cattle business was fairly new there, and when all
the cattle came up over the trail from Texas, and they
certainly did have good cow horses down there. As
Joe says, they were quicker, and readier, as it seems
to me, than the horses we have up here. Of course
that don't mean that they were better horses, but I
suppose it does mean that the Texas horses had been,
as you might say, just raised on cattle. For generations
that was all that they'd been doing and they
were quick as a cat on their feet. It's always seemed
to me that these mountain horses are much more
awkward."</p>

<p>"I've never seen those Texas horses," said Powell;
"but I didn't suppose that they were nearly as strong
as our horses here; and I didn't suppose that they could
hold cattle nearly as well."</p>

<p>"No," replied Joe, "they aren't as strong as these
horses, but for any work like cutting, where you need
quickness, they can handle themselves mighty well."</p>

<p>"Not all those horses," explained Vicente, "make
good cow horses. Some quick, some slow. But good
horse, the more you ride him the better he do his work.
Seems to learn things."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>
<p>"They used to tell about a wonderful cow horse
they had down on the North Platte a few years ago,"
said Hugh. "I heard about him one time from some
punchers I saw in North Platte City, when I was coming
west two or three years ago. They said he belonged
to the Bosler outfit. Maybe you've seen him,
Joe?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well," answered Joe, "if you're going to talk
about Old Blue, I don't believe there ever was a horse
to be compared with him. He was in a class by himself.
In those days he was known all through western
Nebraska and eastern Wyoming. I guess he was the
most noted cow horse there ever was in that country.
He was a Texas horse and, I always heard, came up
with one of the drives. I don't suppose there was ever
a horse like him in all this northern country. I saw
him many times and I happened to be along on one of
the round-ups when he did something that was talked
of for years and maybe is talked of yet down in that
country; I mean the time he cut out a steer all by his
lonesome.</p>

<p>"Old Blue belonged to George Bosler, who was an
active cow man and rode the horse as one of his string.
I reckon Bosler was prouder of that horse than of
anything else he had, and he never got tired of telling
about the horse and how much it knew and what it
could do.</p>

<p>"You know Buffalo Bill had an interest in a bunch
of cattle up north of the Platte; CN was the brand.
Cody and North owned the cattle and they had places
up on the Dismal River."</p>

<p>"Hold on," interrupted Hugh; "you can't tell me
about that! I used to work up there."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>
<p>"Is that so?" said Joe. "That must have been
before I worked up at Bratt's.</p>

<p>"Well, Cody was along with us on one of the round-ups,
and Bosler was telling him all about Old Blue,
and among other things he said that Blue knew the
Bosler brand. Of course, Cody laughed at him and
so I guess did most everybody else; but George Bosler
said he'd prove it, and he'd prove it by riding his horse
into the bunch and cutting out an animal without a
bridle on his horse, so that he couldn't guide it. Well,
everybody thought he must be drunk when he said
that. But he just got on his horse and rode into the
bunch of cattle, and as he rode in among them, he
reached forward and pulled the bridle off his horse.
The horse walked around among the cattle, looking at
them with his ears pricked forward, as though hunting
for something, and pretty soon he pointed his nose
toward a big Texas steer and began to push him out to
the edge of the bunch. You'll hardly believe it, but
that steer had the Bosler brand on him!</p>

<p>"The steer did not want to go out of the bunch
and kept trying to break back, and the horse had a
hard time to keep him going; but he kept right after
him, and did succeed in working him out to the edge
of the bunch, and all this without any guidance at all
by the man, except what Bosler may have given with
his knees. It was a wonderful sight, and by the time
the steer was out of the bunch 'most all the men had
stopped their work and were watching.</p>

<p>"But this wasn't a patch on what came afterward.
When the horse got the steer outside, the steer turned
to fight; and the two stood facing each other. The
steer wanted to get back among the cattle; the horse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>wanted to drive him over to the Bosler bunch. All
the time the steer was threatening with his horns, and
the horse kept moving around from side to side to keep
in front of the steer and yet not let it hook him.</p>

<p>"They maneuvered that way for quite a little while,
and then, all of a sudden when the horse saw his
chance, he made a big jump&mdash;twenty feet clear, I
believe&mdash;and got his breast right against the steer's
neck in such a position that the steer could not hook
him. Then he began to push the steer over toward
the other bunch of cattle, where he wanted to take it.
The steer did not want to go, and braced itself; and
the horse just pushed. It was fearful hard work.
He would push and push and push as far as he could,
until he was tired out; then he'd stand and rest for a
few minutes, while the sweat dropped down; and then
he'd begin pushing the steer again, until finally he
pushed him to the edge of the other bunch of cattle.
All the time the steer was trying to twist around so
as to use his horns, but the horse worked it so that he
never got touched.</p>

<p>"Long before this, all the round-up work had
stopped, and all the men&mdash;I guess there must have
been two hundred and fifty of 'em&mdash;were watching
the horse and wondering at him. I reckon the oldest
cow man there had never seen anything like that before.</p>

<p>"After he'd got the steer over to the edge of the
other bunch and where he wanted it, of course Old Blue
had to figure out some way to get away from the steer
without getting hurt. We were all wondering how
he'd do it, and before long we could see him getting
ready, and could figure on what he was going to do.
He began to draw his hind feet up under him like a cat,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>and at last, giving the steer a great push, he wheeled
on his hind feet and made a long spring&mdash;and struck
the ground running. The steer went for him, but
did not come near catching him.</p>

<p>"That cow horse was in a class by himself. I never
saw another like him, and I've seen thousands of cow
horses, in Texas and California and up in this country."</p>

<p>"That's a wonderful story, Joe," exclaimed Donald;
"almost beyond belief if you hadn't seen it yourself."</p>

<p>"Well," said Joe, "it's a story about a wonderful
horse."</p>

<p>"What sort of horse was he, Joe?" asked Jack.
"Was he a big horse&mdash;a half-breed?"</p>

<p>"No; he was a small Texas horse. I suppose he'd
weigh eight hundred and fifty or nine hundred pounds.
He didn't seem to have any special breeding; but his
head showed a lot of intelligence."</p>

<p>"Nobody could tell, I suppose," Powell remarked,
"whether this was a horse of very great natural intelligence,
or whether he'd been ridden by a man of superior
intelligence."</p>

<p>"No," said Joe; "I reckon that would be all guesswork.
It might have been both. At all events he
was a natural wonder."</p>

<p>"What finally became of him?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>"I don't know. When I left there the Boslers were
still running cattle, and George Bosler owned Old Blue.
The horse got to be so well known after a while that
plenty of men wanted to buy him; but of course Bosler
wouldn't sell him. At that time you could buy a first-class
cow horse in that country for fifty dollars, but I
heard that a man named Sheedy came to Bosler and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>offered him a check for a thousand dollars for Old
Blue. But Bosler just told him that he had no price
to put on the horse; he wasn't for sale."</p>

<p>"Were there any more horses like that down in that
country?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>"No," said Joe, "I don't believe there was one.
Good horses were plenty, but nothing that you could
talk of in the same day with Old Blue. As I tell you,
he was in a class by himself, and anybody that ever
saw him work or knew about him would tell you the
same thing. A man named Carter owned a horse&mdash;a
white horse&mdash;that was said to be the second-best
horse in that round-up; but he wasn't in the same class
with Bosler's horse. He was a good horse and did
his work well, but he couldn't be talked of with Blue.
Then, up on Cody and North's ranch on the Dismal,
they had an awful good horse&mdash;a short-coupled,
strong dun horse that Cody sent out once after he had
lost one of the ranch horses. The horse was branded
JO on the left shoulder and they used to call him Old
Joe. Likely you remember him, Hugh?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Hugh. "He was a good horse and
there wasn't much to choose between him and Carter's
white horse. They were way ahead of the ordinary
cow horses."</p>

<p>"There's one thing you don't want to forget," put in
McIntyre, "and that's what Joe said a while ago.
Down in that country at that time, if I understand it,
there were lots more cattle than we've ever had up
here, and because all these cattle were from Texas and
were wild, active and quick, they had to have quick
horses down there. I've heard men that have worked
down there&mdash;men that came from up in this country
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>I mean&mdash;say that in those days their horses weren't
as good for cutting as the Texas horse. They were
more awkward and lots slower."</p>

<p>"Well," said Hugh, "it's good economy for a cattleman
to have the best cow horses he can get, and practically
all the horses that they used down in that prairie
country came up over the trail from Texas. Why on
the Cody and North ranch they used to buy forty or
fifty horses every year; the poorest ones were culled
out and sold and then the next year another lot bought.
It always seemed odd to me that so few Mexicans came
up over the trail with all those cattle that came. The
country down there was full of Texas cowboys, but
mighty few of 'em were Mexicans. I suppose the fact
that a good many of 'em could not speak English had
something to do with it, and possibly in some places
people did not like 'em; though I never saw anything
like that except where a man was mean or had something
bad about him. Pretty much all the Mexicans
that I've had to do with were as loyal and faithful as
white men&mdash;good workers. We've got a couple with
us now and we all know what they are."</p>

<p>"Yes," assented McIntyre, "they make the best kind
of hands; but we don't see very many of 'em in this
country. I'd like it if we saw more."</p>

<p>For a little time nothing was said.</p>

<p>"Was the cattle business new in this northern country
when you were down in Nebraska, Hugh?" Jack
asked presently.</p>

<p>"It wasn't what you could call new, son, but on the
other hand it hadn't been going very long. The country
wasn't overstocked, and the cow men were careful
and worked hard. They made lots of money."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>
<p>"Do you know when it was, Hugh, that cattle first
came into the country north of the Platte?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's hard to tell. I believe that there were
cattle north of the Platte in 1867. I guess likely they
were Keith's cattle, but I'm not sure. They were
Texas cattle."</p>

<p>"And in those days," asked Donald, "was there
much game in that Nebraska country?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hugh, "a good deal. Lots of antelope
and deer, a good many elk and a few buffalo. I never
happened to see any buffalo just there, but I saw signs
of 'em more than once."</p>

<p>"Why, when I was working down there," said Joe,
"there were still quite a lot of elk. I remember once
seeing Buck Taylor come in to the CN ranch dragging
a big cow elk after him. I don't remember where
they caught her, but I do remember how she looked
when she came. Buck was snaking her along by the
neck, and somebody had put a rope on one of her hind
feet, and she was dragging that. I remember, too,
hearing that one of the Oliffes roped an elk one time,
but somehow or other he couldn't handle him, and I
believe he had to shoot him to get the rope off him."</p>

<p>"Yes," repeated Hugh, "there was plenty of game
there then, and quite a little fur. Old Jim Carson
used to make a living by trapping. Then in those days
there were still a few wild horses in the country. I
don't mean strays that had got away, but real wild
horses, such as we used to have in old times, thirty
or forty years ago."</p>

<p>"Is it possible!" exclaimed Donald. "I'd like to
see them."</p>

<p>"Well," responded Hugh, "you can see pretty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>nearly the same thing, only about a hundred per cent,
better, any time you come across a bunch of range
horses on the prairie. These wild horses were of no
account. They looked as pretty as a picture when
they were fat and slick, but a number of 'em were
caught, and not one of 'em was good for anything. I
chased a bunch once for six or eight miles, and came
near killing a good horse after 'em, and didn't get one.
I'll bet the horse I was riding was worth more than the
whole bunch I was chasing. The romance of the wild
horse is a good deal like the romance of the cowboy's
life: there's nothin' to it."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a><br /><br />

<small><small>ROPING A BEAR</small></small></h2>


<p>The round-up was drawing to its close. Most of
the country to be ridden had already been covered and,
as Joe said, scraped of cattle as if they had gone over
it with a fine-tooth comb. McIntyre was an excellent
cow man, and besides keeping his men up to their work
he himself had covered much ground and had satisfied
himself that his crew had been faithful and thorough.
Most of the cattle had been sent off in bunches to their
home ranges, and now only one day more of riding
was to be done, over a rolling country among the foothills
of the low mountains.</p>

<p>On this last day, Jack, Donald, Vicente and Tulare
Joe were covering a stretch of country among the foothills.
The ground was open, and so rolling that the
riders could see one another only occasionally, yet still
could keep track of one another's movements pretty
well. Donald, who still occupied the position of pupil,
though he had made good progress, rode pretty close
to Jack and was often within hailing distance of him.
There were not many cattle here, and only a few had
been gathered, which Donald was driving along, trying
to keep up with the other riders and yet not to
hurry his cattle.</p>

<p>As Jack rode up toward the crest of a ridge rather
higher than most of the hogbacks coming down from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>the hills, he looked off to the west and saw something
that made him rein in his horse. A rider, too far off
to be recognized, but whom he knew must be Vicente,
was riding in a circle and at the same time signaling
with his hat.</p>

<p>Jack knew, of course, that this was a call to him to
come, and he started at once; on his way picking up
Donald, whom he told to leave his cattle and to come
over to Vicente. Before they reached him, Joe had
joined Vicente, and the two waited for Jack and
Donald.</p>

<p>When the four had got together, Vicente motioned
toward the ridge before them.</p>

<p>"Big bear over this hill; suppose we try catch him."</p>

<p>"Whoop!" cried Jack. "That will be more fun
than a goat! But have we got the ropes to tie him, if
we do catch him?"</p>

<p>"I guess we can make out," said Joe. "Vicente
and me have our macates, and if we can get him fairly
stretched, they ought to do for his hind legs and his
mouth. If we can catch him close to some timber
there'll be no trouble to tie him up, but if we get him
in the flat country where there's nothing to tie him to,
we're liable to kill him. I've heard how they used to
catch bears in California, but I never saw it done myself,
though I've heard the story over and over again.
Maybe Vicente has seen it done. How's that, Vicente?"</p>

<p>"Yes," grinned Vicente, "in my country, sometimes
they catch it bear&mdash;make him fight bull. Suppose
we had big rawhide here; no trouble to catch it bear
and take him to camp."</p>

<p>"You two fellows will have to tell Donald and me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>what to do," said Jack. "We are green at this sort
of thing; but if you will tell us, we will do the best we
can&mdash;eh, Donald?"</p>

<p>The young Englishman's eyes snapped as he nodded.</p>

<p>"Well," decided Joe, "I reckon the best thing to do
is to charge the bear together. I think that Vicente
has the best horse and will get to him first. Then, if
he can catch him by the neck, I'll try to pick up one or
both of his hind feet, and then you two fellows will
have to do the rest. The main thing, of course, is to
keep him from getting one of the ropes in his mouth,
for if he does that he'll just naturally chew it off and
we'll be short a man."</p>

<p>"But," asked Donald, "will these horses go up so
close to a bear that you can rope it?"</p>

<p>"I know that Vicente's will," answered Joe; "Vicente
makes his horses go wherever he wants them to;
and I expect that my horse will be all right, and so
will Jack's. I don't know about yours, Donald.
Guess it will depend a great deal on its rider. Now
before we get ready to charge the bear, we must tighten
our saddles, and see that everything is in good shape;
we don't want to have a saddle slip after we get our
ropes on the bear. Might be kind of unhandy for a
man to be left afoot there."</p>

<p>The boys dismounted, loosened their cinches, pulled
forward the blankets, tightened the cinches again, saw
to it that their ropes were well arranged, and then
everything was ready. Vicente turned his horse and
rode toward the ridge, and the others followed a little
behind him.</p>

<p>Presently Vicente took off his hat, checked his horse
and, letting it go forward only a step or two at a time,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>scanned the country before him. After a few moments
it was evident that he saw something. He bent low
and backed his horse down the slope, rode a few hundred
yards nearer to the higher hills on the right and
then stopped.</p>

<p>"Bear pretty close now; just over ridge."</p>

<p>He started on a gallop toward the crest of the hill;
the others followed only a little behind him; and in a
moment all of them were sweeping down the gentle
slope toward a great brown animal, which for a moment
stood on its hind legs looking at them. Almost
at once it dropped on all fours and raced off at great
speed across the flat and toward another ridge on
which grew a few gnarled and stunted cedars.</p>

<p>The horses were now going at their best gait, down
the slope, across the dry wash near which the bear had
been standing, and over the level flat on the other side.
Vicente's horse had put on a burst of speed that astonished
the other boys. It was rapidly overhauling
the bear, and by the time it had gone about three-quarters
of the way up on the opposite slope Vicente
was swinging his rope. In a moment he threw forward
his hand and, checking his horse, the bear turned
a somersault and struck the ground with a sound heard
by all of them. For a moment the animal lay still,
apparently stunned by the shock, and then, springing
to its feet, it charged furiously down the hill toward
Vicente, whose horse still stood there motionless. Jack
saw Vicente coolly shortening the rope, and then the
little horse made a sidewise rush and again the bear
flew head over heels. At that moment Tulare Joe
caught the hind feet; and the bear, notwithstanding its
great strength, was fairly stretched out between the two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>little horses, which were almost sitting down on the
ground in their resistance to the pull of the two ropes.</p>

<p>There was little time for observation. Quick action
was needed now; action which would render the bear
powerless and would enable Vicente to free the rope
which was about the bear's neck and would soon choke
it to death.</p>

<p>"Try to catch the right fore leg, and I'll catch the
left!" Jack called to Donald; and riding close to the
bear he caught the left foot, and backing his horse
away put a heavy pull on it. Donald had failed to
catch the bear's right fore foot, and was slowly recovering
his rope. He looked as if he did not know what
to do. Meanwhile, the bear was throwing its right
fore leg up over its head and hooking it in Vicente's
rope in the effort to free its head, and Jack feared lest
the long claws might cut the rope or fray it so that it
would break. If the bear's head and one fore leg were
free, it would be a difficult matter to hold it, for it
would readily cut the rope that held the left fore leg.
Vicente recognized this danger before any one, and
every time the bear hooked its right leg over the rope,
Vicente slacked up a little, so that the bear's leg and
foot slipped off the rope, and as soon as this happened
Vicente quickly backed his horse away, until the rope
was taut again.</p>

<p>Seeing to it that his own rope was securely fastened
to his saddle-horn, Jack tumbled off his horse, and ran
swiftly around by the bear's head, jumped over Vicente's
rope and came to the bear's right side. He had
beckoned to Donald, who rode up close to him. Seizing
the loop of Donald's rope, he waited until the bear's
foot was free, threw a small loop over it and told
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>Donald to make the rope fast to the saddle-horn and
back away strongly. Donald was riding a good cow
horse, but it was evidently afraid of a bear and objected
strongly to coming close to this one. However, its
rider at last drove it up close enough to get his hands
on the rope, and when the horse found that it was holding
something, it seemed to gain confidence. Though
snorting and uneasy, with pricked ears, it nevertheless
remained quite still and held the right fore leg so that
the bear could not move it.</p>

<p>"There!" cried Jack, "I guess we have got him!"</p>

<p>All this had been done in a very short time. While
it was happening, Tulare Joe had left his horse and run
around to the bear's head, and now with Jack's assistance
he made a sort of hackamore of his macate and,
binding the loose ends firmly around the bear's jaws,
turned to Vicente and threw up his hand. Vicente at
once slacked up on his rope and Joe loosened it. It
had cut deep into the bear's neck.</p>

<p>For a moment or two the bear lay motionless. Donald
supposed it was dead until Joe, stepping around to
one side, pressed his foot heavily on the animal's chest
close behind the outstretched fore leg and the air from
the lungs came whistling through the bear's mouth and
nostrils. A moment later the animal gasped for breath,
and after two or three intervals began to breathe regularly,
and then to struggle. It threw its head violently
from side to side, and its little eyes snapped with fury,
while it uttered muffled grunts and groans. The boys
stood near its head watching its efforts to free itself
from the ropes. It could move only its head which it
threw from side to side and up and down, beating it
against the ground in its impotent efforts.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>
<p>"Hadn't we better get on our horses?" suggested
Donald. "Suppose one of these ropes breaks, or a
horse yields a little."</p>

<p>"No danger," said Joe; "the ropes and the horses
are all right."</p>

<p>Vicente sat on his horse looking down at the bear.</p>

<p>"Pretty soon he goin' die."</p>

<p>"Why will he die?" asked Jack. "What's going
to kill him?"</p>

<p>"He get pretty mad," answered Vicente. "So mad
can't live any longer. You see."</p>

<p>The words were scarcely out of Vicente's mouth,
when the bear gave a great bawl and then lay still,
except for a few convulsive quivers. As Vicente had
foretold, he had died of rage. The boys watched him
closely, and gradually they saw his eyes grow dull.</p>

<p>"Well," said Jack, "I'm sorry that the old fellow
died. It seems as if it would have been better for him
to have been killed by a bullet than to die in this way."</p>

<p>"Yes," responded Donald, "it does seem sort of an
ignominious death to be caught and stretched out on
the prairie like this, perfectly helpless. On the other
hand, if he had ever gotten a wipe at one of our horses
with those paws of his, I am afraid that there would
not have been much left of the horse."</p>

<p>"We may as well get our ropes back again," said Joe,
"and go ahead about our business. Do you boys want
to take off the hide? It'll make a pretty good robe for
one of you."</p>

<p>"I should like very much to have it, if nobody else
wants it," said Donald. "How do you feel about it,
Jack?"</p>

<p>"Why," replied Jack, "if you want it, you had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>better have it, and Joe and me here will help you take
the hide off. It's no joke to skin a bear. It takes a
long time and is hard work, and you get covered with
grease while you're doing it. However, we may as
well pitch in and get it out of the way."</p>

<p>"Well," drawled Vicente; "me, I goin' off to look
for cattle; when you get ready, suppose you come
along."</p>

<p>"All right," answered Jack. "It won't take us very
long. We will put the hide on Donald's horse, and
then Joe and I will hurry on to catch up with you."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it was nearly an hour before the hide
was freed from the carcass and done up in as compact
a bundle as possible; and then ten or fifteen minutes
more had to be devoted to the work of getting it on
Donald's horse, for the animal wholly objected to the
smell of the load. At last, however, the work was
completed and Donald mounted; but no sooner had
the blind been lifted from the horse's eyes than it
began to pitch, and so furiously and long that the boys
feared that Donald might be thrown and hurt. They
threw their ropes over the horse's head, and called to
Donald to dismount. He did not greatly care to do
this, but finally did so, and the boys advised him to
turn about and go home, leading his horse at least for
a mile or two before attempting to mount it. They
would go on and finish their circle, and would then
come around to the camp.</p>

<p>Before he began his walk to camp Donald saw the
other boys mount their horses and ride off over the
hills. As soon as he started, his horse began to make
trouble for him. It began by bucking hard at the end of
the rope, and Donald was somewhat uneasy lest either
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>the strings which bound the hide on the horse's back
should stretch, or come loose, or else the saddle should
shift. In this case he would lose his hide, for once on
the ground it was not likely that one man could tie it
on the horse again. Fortunately, everything held, for
Tulare Joe before leaving him had carefully gone over
all the fastenings. Even after the horse had ceased
bucking, it was very uneasy, looking back at its load
and trying to bolt, or occasionally swerving from side
to side and dragging Donald about on the end of the
rope. He had not had sufficient experience with a
rope to understand how to hold a horse effectively, and
sometimes he was dragged along, with arms outstretched,
for a number of yards over the prairie, before
the horse yielded to the pull of the rope. A man
of greater experience would readily have stopped the
horse in a number of its rushes by throwing his right
hand behind his hip and then leaning back against the
rope, but Donald had not yet learned how to do this
and during his long walk back to camp he suffered
much discomfort because of his lack of knowledge.</p>

<p>Two or three times he thought that he would mount
his horse; but each time the beast threatened trouble,
so that Donald feared he might lose his bear skin off
the saddle; and now, since he had worked so hard to
save it, he was determined that he would take no risks
about it. It occurred to him also that if his horse
should get away from him and should run to camp
and in among the cávaya, the loose horses would be
certain to stampede, and might be scattered far over
the prairie. It seemed better to walk the whole way
than to take a risk such as this.</p>

<p>So he kept walking; and it was a hot, dirty and weary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>young Englishman who at length reached the camp.
He tied his rope short to a wagon wheel and took the
bear skin from his horse, and then unsaddled and
turned loose the animal.</p>

<p>It was some hours later when Vicente, Jack and
Tulare Joe reached camp with a small bunch of cattle.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a><br /><br />

<small><small>A CALIFORNIA BEAR HUNT</small></small></h2>


<p>That evening in camp Jack and Donald were full
of the exploits of the day&mdash;the roping and death
of the bear.</p>

<p>"What I can't understand yet," said Donald, "is
why that bear died. Vicente said that it died because
it was so mad; and certainly we know that it died, and
without being hurt, except so far as it was choked before
we got it stretched out. Did you ever hear of anything
of that kind, Hugh? I suppose you know more
about bears than anybody in the camp."</p>

<p>"Well," replied Hugh, "of course, I've seen bears
in my time, and seen some of 'em killed, but I don't
know anything more about whether they'll die of anger
than you do. I expect the only men that can tell you
much about that are Vicente here and Joe. I've heard
more than once something about grizzly bears dying
because they were mad; but I don't know anything
about it."</p>

<p>"Come on, Joe," laughed Jack, "we've got to go
back to you Californians now for information. California
is the only place I ever heard of where they regularly
roped grizzlies, and I suppose it's a long time
since they did much of that."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Joe; "it's a long time ago. The
big California grizzlies had got to be mighty scarce long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>before I learned how to throw a rope; but here's Vicente&mdash;he's
seen it done, for he told me so to-day.
And I've heard a man, who did it before I was born,
tell a story of what he himself had seen in California
in early days."</p>

<p>"Well, I reckon we'll have to squeeze a story or two
out of you and Vicente to-night," said Hugh; "but first
I'd like to hear what you know, or have heard, about
bears dying of anger."</p>

<p>"I know just about as much about it as any of the
rest of us here," responded Joe. "It used to be common
talk out in California that bears would die of
anger; and the one we saw to-day certainly acted that
way. At the same time, I don't suppose all bears are
alike in their temper or feelings any more than all men
are alike."</p>

<p>"I should say not," declared Hugh; "and that's
what I've been trying to tell the people for a good many
years. Men say that deer, or antelope, or coyotes, or
jack-rabbits, always act in a certain way, under certain
circumstances; but I don't believe a word of it.
There's just as much difference in antelope and coyotes
and jack-rabbits as there is in horses and cattle and
dogs. Some are fast, others slow; some gentle, others
wild; some are cross, others friendly; in other words,
all the animals of a certain kind are not exactly alike,
and don't all act alike."</p>

<p>"I guess everybody believes that, Hugh," said
Powell, "if he stops to think of it, but the trouble with
most of us is that we don't stop to think."</p>

<p>"That's sure what's the matter with most of the
people in this country," replied Hugh; "they don't stop
to think. They've got sense enough, if they'd only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>think. Well, Joe, tell us your story, the one you heard;
or let's hear the one Vicente has to tell."</p>

<p>"I'll give you mine easy enough," said Joe. "It
happened just about the time I was born, I suppose in
the late '50s, and near a place called San Pascual. It
seems that bears had been making trouble killing colts,
and the men at the ranch made up their minds that
they'd try to get 'em, or some of 'em; and if they got
a bear, they'd take it to one of the towns near by and
have a bear fight by fastening the bear and a bull together.
Just about that time one of the men came in
and reported another colt killed, and its mother badly
scratched up; so two or three of the men, one of whom
was supposed to know everything about bears, went
out and looked the ground over to decide what to do.
Finally they killed the old crippled mare on a low flat
piece of prairie a mile wide and about three miles long
and then took her paunch and dragged it, making a
circuit of about ten miles, and finally came back to the
carcass. They found in the trails the tracks of an old
bear and three big cubs, and saw that they were traveling
around pretty much all the time. When the men
dragged the paunch they crossed a good many of these
trails.</p>

<p>"While this was being done, other men went out
and drove in the horses, and the best broken ones were
picked out for those who were going to ride after the
bear. Of course every man looked after his saddle.
If any of the latigo strings, or any of the strings of
the saddle or the bridle were worn a little, they were
taken off and new strings put there. It wouldn't do to
have anything break when they were going to try for
a bear.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>
<p>"The next morning early a man was sent out to
go to the bait, and to where the paunch had been
dragged, so as to learn if the bears had found it. He
came back soon, and said it looked as if there had
been a thousand bears going over the trail where the
paunch had been dragged. He said that they had eaten
considerable of the old mare.</p>

<p>"The men who were the leaders&mdash;the bear sharps&mdash;said
the bears would come back that night, and that
all hands ought to be within earshot of the bait by
moonrise. So by dark all the horses were saddled, and
about ten o'clock the head man called the outfit and led
'em down toward the bait. Before they got anywhere
near it, they could hear the coyotes yelping on the hills
all around the bait, and they knew that the bears were
at work. If the bears had not been there the coyotes
would be eating and not yelling. When they began to
get near the place, they all stopped and tied up the
chains and the tinklers on their spurs, so that these
wouldn't be heard, and then waited for the moon to
rise. After a while the moon came up over the mountains,
and then very quietly they jogged along until
they got between the bait and the ravine out of which
the bears' trail had come the night before. Then, facing
around they rode in a line toward the bait.</p>

<p>"The leading man had told 'em that those who
couldn't rope&mdash;and that meant pretty much all the
Americans in the bunch&mdash;had better stay behind and
either try to catch the cubs, or else to pound 'em with
their ropes and try to turn 'em. The leading man, Don
Juan, was going to rope the bear, and he was to be
supported by two other good ropers, both Californians.</p>

<p>"Well, according to the story, they got quite close
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>to the bait before anything happened, and then an
enormous bear stood up and looked at 'em. The man
who told me said that she looked to him as tall as a
pine tree; but I guess he wasn't used to seeing bears.
At all events, even if she did have her cubs with her,
she put out across the flat making for a big cañon
that was quite a long way off.</p>

<p>"Don Juan and his partners kept after her and before
very long caught up and Don Juan put his rope
around her neck. But before he knew it she threw
it off, and he had to slow down a little to gather his
rope. Another man drew up to try to rope her, but
the bear gave a snort that scared his horse so that
it ran away. Finally the third man got up to her and,
roping her with a big loop, caught her around the
neck and behind her shoulder, and the rope stayed.
She turned and charged on three legs, one of her fore
legs being held close to her neck, but she never arrived,
for Don Juan came up at that moment and
caught both hind feet and in a minute she was handsomely
stretched. Garcia, the man who had been on
the frightened horse now came up. Taking his
macate to hold his horse with, he went up to Don Juan,
who in the meantime had ridden up within ten feet
of the bear's hind legs, shortening his rope all the
time, and so leaving about twenty feet behind the
horn of the saddle. He passed this end to Garcia,
who was now on foot, and Garcia, passing the end
of the rope through the loop that was about the bear's
neck and front foot, carried the end back to Don
Juan and helped him hold the bear's hind legs, while
he took up the slack of the rope that had been passed
through the neck loop. When this was done and he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>got a pull on the rope, the bear's hind feet came
close up to its neck, and it was in kind of a ball.</p>

<p>"They'd provided themselves with strings and ropes,
and now that the bear was helpless her mouth was
tied up, and then the three men, putting their ropes
on her, dragged her to a tree, and, after a good deal
of work and fussing around, got one hind foot on
either side of the tree trunk, and tied the two together
on the other side. The bear's hind feet were
thus useless to her. She could walk around on her
fore feet and dig holes in the ground with 'em, but
it was impossible for her to get at the lashing which
held her hind feet.</p>

<p>"All the other ropes were then taken off and she
was left there for the night.</p>

<p>"Meantime, the cubs had been attacked by the
Americans, and after a whole lot of excitement all
the three were captured and tied up.</p>

<p>"The next morning they got fresh horses and all
went back there and carried a beef hide with them.
You heard Vicente say yesterday that if we had a beef
hide we could take the bear to camp, didn't you,
Jack?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I heard him say that, but I didn't know
what he meant."</p>

<p>"Well," said Joe, "you'll know if you'll listen to
this story.</p>

<p>"When they got to the bear, Don Juan made a
rough measurement of the distance there'd be between
the two front feet and the two hind feet of the bear
if she was lying stretched out on the ground, and
then in the beef hide he cut holes at different points.</p>

<p>"Now strong ropes, wound with sheep skin to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>keep the ropes from cutting her, were put around the
bear's fore feet and hind feet. The beef hide was
moved up close to her head, the ropes attached to the
fore feet were passed through the holes in the fore
part of the beef hide, and the bear was slid forward
on to the hide and the ropes drawn tight. Then the
ropes on the hind legs were passed through the holes
cut at the back end of the beef hide and drawn tight
and there lay the old bear, stretched out flat with the
beef hide under her and firmly attached to it. They
say it made the white men who had just come into
the country stare to see the way the Californians
handled the ropes and the bear.</p>

<p>"When the bear was fixed there to the hide, another
rope was fastened to the head of the beef hide;
and then with three men ahead, each with a turn of
one of the ropes around his saddle-horn, and two men
behind to keep the hide properly stretched, the outfit
set out for the ranch.</p>

<p>"The cubs were tied up and packed on horses, and
the whole family, except one cub that had died, successfully
taken to the house.</p>

<p>"The next day, after they had put another hide
under the bear, they hauled her down along the road
to the town. They say that they had lots of fun on
the way down, for every ox-team and burro train
that they met on the road, just as soon as it got
a smell of the bear, started from the road and took
to the open country.</p>

<p>"There in the town they got a bull and brought
the bear into the corral and fastened bull and bear
together by a long chain and then turned both animals
loose. Of course, it don't seem to have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>half fair to the bear, for she had been tied up for a
couple of days and must have been fearfully stiff.
However, she was ready to fight. But it was pretty
short; the bull managed to stick his horns through
her after a little bit, and killed her."</p>

<p>Jack drew a long breath.</p>

<p>"Gee, wouldn't I like to have been there!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"They certainly were handy with the rope in those
days," said Hugh.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Joe; "they were. Vicente was telling
me to-day about his uncle's catching a bear and
tying it up all alone. It seemed to me a pretty good
story. I don't believe you can understand more than
half of it if he tries to tell it in English. Suppose I
get him to tell it to me in Spanish, and tell you just
what he says."</p>

<p>"Bully!" responded McIntyre; "that'll make it a
whole lot plainer."</p>

<p>For a moment Joe and Vicente spoke together in
Spanish, and then Joe turned to the others.</p>

<p>"All right," he said; "here goes:</p>

<p>"It seems that Vicente's uncle was riding through
some thick willows in a wet place on a ranch in California,
when suddenly he felt his horse stagger and
heard the sound of a slap. He knew that a bear had
hit at him and missed him, and hit the horse, and the
horse went flying out of the willows into the open
grass with the bear charging at his heels. His uncle
slowed down a little and let the bear get pretty close,
bending off toward a low, stout willow that grew alone.
When he got nearly up to it he dodged a little to one
side, stopped his horse, and as the bear passed, roped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>him by one hind leg and, riding half a dozen times
around this willow, drew the bear up close to the tree.
Of course, the bear was biting at his hind foot all
the time, trying to get rid of the rope. Vicente's
uncle tied the end of the rope to an outside limb;
then riding up close to the bear in front&mdash;of course
it was making desperate efforts to get at the man&mdash;he
threw his hair rope over the bear's neck, fastened
it to his saddle-horn and backed his horse off so as
to hold the bear. Then the man got off his horse,
took off his silk sash, went around behind the bear
which was held by the horse, and tied his hind legs
together behind the tree. That was all there was to
it."</p>

<p>"Gosh, that was enough!" exclaimed Jack Mason.
"We don't know anything about what those old fellows
used to do with horses and cattle and bears."</p>

<p>"That's so," drawled Vicente. "In those times
they often sent out a man alone to kill and butcher a
steer and bring it in to camp. Pretty dangerous, all
of it; but the vaquero must not be afraid."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br /><br />

<small><small>HUNTING WITH A SIX-SHOOTER</small></small></h2>


<p>The round-up was over and the representatives of
the various brands had started off in different directions
toward their home ranches, taking with them
the few cattle that had been gathered during these
last days. With the Sturgis party went also Jack
Mason, whom McIntyre had engaged only for the
round-up, and who was beginning to get uneasy and
to long to resume his wandering life. When he paid
him off, McIntyre said to Mason that he would be glad
to have him work on the ranch for the rest of the
season, and even hinted that he would give him a
job for the winter, but to these proposals Mason
shook his head, laughingly, and declared that his steady
job had lasted long enough and that now he was going
to make a little trip.</p>

<p>There were thus five men in the party that was traveling
toward Swift Water Ranch. They had about fifty
head of cattle and twenty-five horses to drive. The
distance was short, the weather fine, and they expected
to reach the ranch in three or four days, at
the most.</p>

<p>The morning after the round-up outfits had separated,
they started in good season, traveling up a broad
open valley between the mountains, where in many
places the grass stood well above the horses' knees.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>As they drove along, antelope were constantly seen
ahead of them, which, though not shy, always moved
off ahead, or ran up the open side valleys which at
short intervals emptied into the main one.</p>

<p>"Son," Hugh said to Jack, who was riding near
him, "why don't you and Donald go ahead and try
to kill a buck antelope with your pistols? I'm getting
hungry for a piece of wild meat. I've had so
much beef lately that it seems to me I can pretty near
feel my horns sprouting;" and he rubbed his hand
over the side of his head. "The buck antelope ought
to be in pretty fair order now, and I don't know why
you shouldn't be able to get up pretty close to 'em,
if you work along close to the side of the valley,
and see the antelope before they see you. They're
great fellows, you know, to climb up and lie where
they can look out over the country. If you had rifles
you'd be sure to get a shot or two. I don't know
what kind of a pistol shot you are. Most of us can't
do much with these short guns, though Major Frank
North, down in Nebraska, could kill game as well with
a pistol as I could with a rifle. Many a time I've seen
him kill deer and antelope at a hundred yards, what
we'd think was a good rifle shot, and he was using
just an ordinary revolver."</p>

<p>"That's a good idea, Hugh. We'll do it. I'd like
to give Donald a chance. He hasn't had any show
yet to hunt, and I expect that's what he came out here
for."</p>

<p>"Is it?" inquired Hugh. "I haven't seen him
carry a rifle, and I didn't know what he was out here
for."</p>

<p>"Well," Jack admitted, "I don't know either; it's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>just my guess that maybe he came out to have a
hunt."</p>

<p>"Then take him along. You're not needed here,
and I certainly would like to have some wild meat
hung up in camp."</p>

<p>Jack asked Donald if he wanted to go and see
whether they could kill an antelope with their pistols,
and there was no doubt about Donald's readiness;
so it was not long before the two young fellows, riding
out well to one side of the little herd, galloped
off up the valley and, waving to Rube as they passed,
were soon out of sight behind a point of the hills.</p>

<p>When they were well beyond sight or sound of the
herd, Jack drew in his horse and, turning toward the
edge of the valley, repeated to Donald what Hugh
had said.</p>

<p>"What we want to do," Jack went on, "is to keep
as close as we can to the edge of the valley and watch
the ground ahead for antelope. Along toward the
middle of the morning they're likely to get up pretty
high and to lie down where they can have a good
look over the open land. If we can see one lying
down, or can see one working toward a place where
it looks as if he might lie down, we may be able to get
right close to him. Now, I've used a pistol mighty
little, and I don't feel at all sure that I can hit anything
with it. Have you ever used a pistol much?"</p>

<p>"In past years in England, and in New York, I
have done some shooting with a pistol at a target, but
of course I have never shot at game; and I fancy that
to shoot at game is very different from shooting at a
target, in a quiet place with all the lights arranged
just so."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes," laughed Jack, "I should think it would be;
but if you know how to shoot a pistol, you'll have to
do your best to kill the game. I tell you, if we come
in to-night without anything, I shall lay it up against
you."</p>

<p>"I'll do what I can," Donald promised, "if you
will take me up close enough to get a fair shot. You
see in the shooting-galleries the distances are short,
scarcely ever over twenty yards; and what is more,
the people there shoot with special pistols, and often
with special ammunition. So if I flunk on killing
game, you can see I will have plenty of excuses. Besides
that, I don't know anything about this pistol&mdash;it's
a new one I've just bought, and I can't tell anything
about how it's going to shoot."</p>

<p>The hills which bordered the valley on either side
were low, but rough, rocky ledges often thrust themselves
out to the valley's edge, and from these ledges
great pink or reddish rocks, occasionally worn into
queer shapes, had fallen. Sometimes around such a
great rock was a little tangle of underbrush&mdash;cherry,
currant and raspberries&mdash;while sometimes there was
no brush and the yellow grass grew close about the
rocks. It was up here on the higher land that Jack
hoped to find antelope lying down, and, under cover
of rocks and brush and the inequalities of the ground,
to be able to get close enough to kill one with a pistol.</p>

<p>As they rode on, it became clear that Hugh had
sent them to a good hunting place for antelope.
Groups of these animals, or sometimes old bucks feeding
singly, could be seen every few hundred yards for
a long distance ahead. Some of the bucks seemed
to carry extraordinarily large horns, which would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>make fine trophies to hang on the wall, and both Jack
and Donald regretted that they did not have their
rifles.</p>

<p>Donald, whose experience in hunting was much less
than Jack's, was anxious to try to approach the first
bunch of antelope they saw; but Jack pointed out to
him that this could not be done, because there was
little or no cover. He explained further that if they
started the antelope running along this valley, they
would put every animal there on the alert, and their
hunting later in the day would be just so much the
more difficult.</p>

<p>"If we ride along close to the rocks here," he
said, "the antelope will pay little attention to us.
Some of them will stand and look, and perhaps walk
off a little way, but when they see us go on about our
business they will begin to feed again. Along toward
the middle of the day, if we keep our eyes well
open, we are pretty sure to find some of these big
bucks lying down close to the hills, and then we'll
give you a chance to see what you can do with your
six-shooter."</p>

<p>"All right," agreed Donald; "all right; you're the
hunter, and I am perfectly willing to follow along behind
and do what you tell me to."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's not that. But I've had more experience
than you, and I know better than you what animals
will do under certain circumstances. Why," Jack
laughed, "don't I remember the first antelope I ever
killed! How crazy I was to get up to it, and how I
fell down two or three times on the way to the top
of the hill, and how I finally scared the antelope out
of the country! I believe that was one of the best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>lessons in hunting I ever learned. I made such a
complete fool of myself, that I even saw it myself,
and it humbled me and made me ask Hugh to put me
on the right road, and to keep me traveling there."</p>

<p>Donald was interested in all hunting matters, and
he was anxious to have Jack tell him the whole story
of that hunt in detail. Somewhat reluctantly, Jack
told him something of his adventures during his first
visit to his uncle's ranch, when he was known as
"Jack, the Young Ranchman."</p>

<p>As the boys rode up the valley, new vistas of its
yellow surface and of the side ravines that came
into it were constantly opening up, and distant animals
were often seen which Donald could not always
identify, and which he took for deer, or elk, or
even cattle. Jack assured him, however, that they
were all antelope.</p>

<p>"How do you know?" Donald asked. "Now
there's a beast far off that looks black, and looks as if
it had big horns. How do you know that that's an
antelope?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you how I know, but I do know that
it's an antelope. You say it looks black; well, so it
does, but on the other hand, look where the sun is,
and you'll see that the reason it looks black is because
the part of it that we see is mostly in the shadow,
while everything around about is in that bright sunlight.
You say it looks as if it had big horns, and
I'll acknowledge that it does&mdash;but look at it now.
Can you see its horns?"</p>

<p>"No," said Donald; "it seems to have lost its
horns."</p>

<p>"It has to our eyes," explained Jack, "because it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>has turned its head, and we don't see the horns from
the point of view that we did before. It would be
hard for me to say positively that any of those things
were not elk or cattle, but I'm dead sure that they are
all antelope, because at this time of the day there
would not be any elk in this place; that's one thing;
another thing is, if they were cattle they would look
different. They would be squarer, broader, heavier.
Hold on there! Bend down slow, and slip off your
horse!"</p>

<p>In a moment the boys were on the ground.</p>

<p>"Did you see him?" Jack whispered.</p>

<p>"No," answered Donald; "I didn't see anything."</p>

<p>"Why, there's a big buck antelope lying there, not
seventy-five yards away, and he didn't see us either.
I believe we can crawl up close enough to get a
shot. Look here, you said just now that you didn't
know your pistol, and didn't know how you could
shoot with it. Do you want to take mine? I can
tell you how it shoots, but I don't know that that'll
do much good. If you can get near enough to the
buck and can find a place to rest the pistol, you had
better shoot at him from a rest."</p>

<p>"Well, how are we going to get near him?" asked
Donald. "I don't know where he is. You will have
to crawl up to him, and when you get to the right
place, call me up and I'll shoot."</p>

<p>"I think we can get up to him all right," said Jack.
"He's lying up on a little bench, and I believe we
can crawl along under the bank right close to him.
The only danger is that he'll see you when you rise
to shoot; and I suppose if you have to shoot at him
on the run, you'll miss him."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>
<p>"I'm sure I shall; but let's try, anyhow."</p>

<p>They threw down the reins of their horses, and
turning toward the valley crept very carefully down
into a little sag. Jack pointed ahead to where a great
rock showed sixty or seventy yards away.</p>

<p>"He's lying right at the foot of that rock; between
us and it. Now, we'll have to crawl along this
low place, sticking as flat to the ground as we know
how, and then when we get within thirty or forty
yards, you lift up your head and find him and kill
him, if you can. If you miss him, I may take a pop
at him; but I'm certain I shan't hit him when he's
running. But, say," he cautioned in a whisper, "don't
you take your pistol out of your holster until you
get ready to shoot, and I won't take mine out either.
I'm afraid that if we have them in our hands we
might kill each other instead of the antelope."</p>

<p>"All right," agreed Donald.</p>

<p>Jack threw off his hat and Donald did the same,
and the boys crept along very cautiously and slowly.
As they advanced, the top of the rock seemed to come
nearer and nearer, and at length they were quite
close to it. Presently Jack stopped, looked back and
motioned with his hand for Donald to creep up beside
him.</p>

<p>"Now you go up very slowly on your knees," he
whispered, "and try to find him. Remember that
the first thing you will see is his black horns sticking
up. If you see them close together, his head will
be turned out toward the valley; if you see them wide
spread he'll be looking straight in our direction.
Wait, if you can, until he looks out toward the valley,
and then rise and shoot. You'll have to shoot pretty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>quickly, for he's almost certain to see us. Raise your
head very slowly."</p>

<p>Donald gathered his legs under him and very slowly
rose to his knees, at the same time feeling for his
six-shooter. Gradually as his head rose higher and
higher, his hand went around to his hip; but when he
was standing on his knees it was evident that he saw
nothing. He looked at Jack, who motioned with his
hand toward the rock, and Donald crept forward a
little way up the bank. This time when he raised
his head, he saw the animal. He drew his pistol and
noiselessly cocked it, waited a moment and then, raising
his head and hand slowly, he fired.</p>

<p>Jack was on his knees behind Donald and had his
pistol ready, but nothing stirred.</p>

<p>"You must have got him!" Jack cried.</p>

<p>The boys quickly jumped to their feet and climbed
up the bank, and there was the antelope, his head
stretched out before him.</p>

<p>"Let's get a knife into him!" exclaimed Jack.
"He may be only creased."</p>

<p>A few steps brought the boys to him, and taking
hold of the antelope's horn Jack thrust in his knife
at the point of the breast. Then he saw that the ball
had entered just below the head and had broken the
antelope's neck.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" he cried, "that was a good shot, and
a quick shot! If that wasn't an accident, it was certainly
a way up shot. I'd give a good deal to be
able to shoot a pistol like that three times out of
five."</p>

<p>"It was a lucky shot, sure enough," laughed Donald.
"I can't do that sort of thing three times out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>of five, nor three times out of ten. I wish I could."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll have to have some pistol practise
when we get back to the ranch, for if you can do this
thing often, I'll want you to give me some lessons."</p>

<p>The boys dressed the antelope, which was a fine
old buck with a pair of long, spreading horns.</p>

<p>"This will tickle Hugh," said Jack, "for it's just
what he asked for&mdash;a good piece of wild meat."</p>

<p>They left the antelope where it lay, and riding out
a short distance from the hills so that they could see
the whole valley, they took the saddles and bridles
from their horses and let them feed while they sat
there and talked until the slow traveling herd had
come almost to where they were. Then they saddled
up again, went back to the antelope, and putting it on
Donald's horse rode down and joined the others.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a><br /><br />

<small><small>A LOAD OF MEAT</small></small></h2>


<p>The sun was hanging low in the western sky on
the evening of the second day after this when the
little bunch of stock, having entered the home valley
and crossed the streams which ran down from the
low mountains back of the ranch, approached the corner
of the pasture and saw the lake. The low ranch
buildings were still hidden behind the hills, but all
the surroundings were those of home. The cattle
were left by the lake to mingle with the others that
within the past few weeks had been brought to the
home range, but the men drove the horses along, intending
to turn them into the big pasture until it had
been determined what saddle animals should be kept
up. Most of them, however, would be turned out, and
would do no more work until the beef round-up a
couple of months later.</p>

<p>There was no especial work for any one to do, and
Hugh asked Jack why he and Donald did not ride
on to the house and see Mr. Sturgis. When this was
suggested Donald said he would be very glad to do
so.</p>

<p>"I have not said anything to you about it, Jack,
but I have a letter of introduction to Mr. Sturgis from
my uncle, who is an old friend of his. I think that
they were in college together, a good many years ago."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>
<p>"Well," said Jack, "you'll like Uncle Will all
right, I know. If you don't, you'll be different from
most of the other people in this country. Of course
I like him because he's my uncle, and perhaps you
might say Hugh likes him because he works for him,
but I think you'll find that most people on the range
and at the railroad think a good deal of him. I once
overheard a man say to another: 'What I like about
that man Sturgis is that he don't put on any airs; he's
just as common as you and me.' That sounds a little
queer, of course, because back East when anybody
speaks of another person as common, it has a
bad sound; but I reckon out here they use the word
in a sense that maybe we have forgotten."</p>

<p>The boys started ahead, and turning the corner of
the pasture fence they galloped along toward the house
which they could now see. No one seemed to be
stirring, until they were near enough to the blacksmith
shop to hear the ringing of hammer on anvil,
and for the hoof-beats of their horses to be heard
in the shop. Then Joe, with a hammer in one hand
and a pair of tongs in the other, looked out of the
door, and on recognizing Jack shouted a greeting and
waved his tools. The boys drew up by the corral
fence and tied their horses, and then, having shaken
hands with Joe, went up to the house to see Mr.
Sturgis. He was found writing in the sitting-room,
and welcomed the boys cordially. When he had read
Donald's letter he gave him an extra handshake and
told him that he must stay there as long as he would.
Donald's arrival had not been altogether a surprise to
Mr. Sturgis, for among the mail waiting at the ranch
were two or three letters for the young Englishman,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>as well as for Jack; and after the first greetings were
over the two boys retired to read their mail.</p>

<p>Among Jack's was a letter from Sam Williams,
saying that he was in Cheyenne and had succeeded in
getting work; that he had left the horse and saddle
at Brown's livery stable, as promised, and that when
Jack was ready, he would be glad to have him send
him the fifteen dollars still due him on the saddle and
bridle. Jack felt that he must inquire about this at
once, and see that Williams got his money as soon
as possible.</p>

<p>When the reading of the letters was over, Mr.
Sturgis looked up from his writing.</p>

<p>"Jack," he said, "Hugh told me about the trouble
over at Powell's the day you started away from
here, and a few days ago when Joe was in town,
Brown told him that some weeks before a man had
left at his stable that gray horse and a saddle and
bridle which were to come out to you here. Joe
brought them out. He brought out Donald's trunk
on the same trip."</p>

<p>"Yes, Uncle Will; I have a letter here from the
young fellow who left the things at Brown's, saying
that he had done so. I owe him some money on
that saddle, and must see that it goes to him the next
time anybody goes to town."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Sturgis, "don't neglect that. If
you really owe money, pay it as quickly as you can.
How do you mean to send it to the man? I can give
you a check, of course, but that may not be the most
convenient way for him."</p>

<p>"No," replied Jack, "I guess it wouldn't be. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>should be sent either in currency in a registered letter,
or by post-office order. I suppose a money order
would be the safest."</p>

<p>"I think so too, but of course it is a little more
trouble. However, I think I would send it in that
way. You would not care to have to pay the money
twice. Speak to me about it the next time any one
goes to town. I think perhaps somebody will have to
go before very long."</p>

<p>"There come the horses, Uncle Will," said Jack.
"Don't you want to go out and look at them? They're
all in first-class shape, it seems to me, considering the
work that they have had to do; but between now and
the fall round-up they'll fatten up and be in splendid
shape for that."</p>

<p>They walked down to the barn and saw the horses
turned into the corral, and Mr. Sturgis shook hands
with Mason, whom until now he had never met. The
loads taken off the horses were dropped in front of
the bunk-house, for Jack and Donald had agreed that
they would stop down there; they would not sleep
at the house. To this Mr. Sturgis at first demurred
a little, but assented when the boys had given him
their reasons.</p>

<p>For two or three days now nothing seemed to happen
at the ranch. The saddle horses were turned into
the big pasture, and the men who had just come in
from the round-up camp loafed about the house, reading
or talking, or sleeping. Very likely they were all
a little tired from their long hard work and enjoyed
the days of idleness; but that could not last. Their
lives had been too active for them to settle down into
doing nothing. Therefore, when Mrs. Carter announced
one day at breakfast that the supply of fresh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>meat was running low, Mr. Sturgis with a smile asked
Jack and Donald whether they wished to go out and
kill a load of meat, or whether he should send out
and have a beef driven in.</p>

<p>The boys declared that they would make the hunt;
and up on the mountain back of the house, where the
elk had their summer home, seemed the only place
to go. To be sure, there was a bunch of antelope over
in the big pasture, and a few mule deer lived in some
of the ravines running down from the hills; but Mr.
Sturgis liked to see these animals near the house and
had requested his own people and their neighbors not
to disturb either the deer or the antelope.</p>

<p>Jack and Donald agreed therefore that the next
morning they would climb the mountain and try to
find an elk; and when Jack Mason heard of it, he
said that he wanted to go along, if his job should be
only to lead the pack horse. He was already tired
of loafing.</p>

<p>Mr. Sturgis had decided to send Hugh to town
the next day, and that evening Jack arranged with
him to get a money order to send to Williams at
Cheyenne.</p>

<p>Soon after breakfast the following morning, the
three started on their hunt. To Jack the trail up the
mountain was familiar enough, for he had known it
now since small boyhood. To the others it was new
and full of interest; and Donald, especially, looked
down with great interest and curiosity into the deep,
narrow and dark ravines above which the trail ran.</p>

<p>Suddenly Jack, who was in the lead, held up his
hand, and then slowly slipped off his horse on the
upper side and came quietly back to Donald and Mason.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>
<p>"There are five bull elk," he said, "down here in
this ravine, just a little ahead of us. I don't think
we want to kill them, but you might like to see them,
Donald. I don't know if you ever saw elk at this
time of the year, just when their horns are half
grown. It's interesting to see them go through the
thick timber, and to notice how careful they are to
keep from knocking their horns against the trunks
and branches among which they travel. Of course,
the horns are very tender at this season, and the animals
take the greatest care not to hit them against
anything."</p>

<p>"I'd greatly like to see them, Jack. Can we get
a look at them?"</p>

<p>"Yes; slip off your horse, and we can go forward
on foot and get a look at them, I think. They were
moving when I saw them, but I don't think they saw
me."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mason, "I'll stay back, and bring the
horses on up to your horse, Jack."</p>

<p>"All right," answered Jack; and he and Donald
went forward. They had passed Jack's horse only
about twenty feet, when Jack stopped and pointed,
and in a moment Donald could see the yellow bodies
of the elk showing up in the shadow as they walked
along the ravine.</p>

<p>"Shan't we kill one?" whispered Donald after a
moment.</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem worth while. These fellows are
growing their horns now, and they'll be poor enough
for a month longer. You know, those horns grow
about as fast as corn, and they're a terrible drain on
the animal. On the other hand, just as soon as they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>have got their growth, and begin to harden, the bull
elk lay on fat in a way to astonish anybody, and by
the end of August, or first of September, they are
fit to kill&mdash;hog fat. Besides that, even if these elk
were in good order now, we don't want to finish our
hunt at the very beginning of the day, and then have
to go back to the ranch and stay around there until
night. If we keep on we can very likely find a yearling
or a two-year-old heifer that will make us good
meat and be worth bringing back."</p>

<p>For some time the boys watched the elk's slow progress
up the ravine, but at length the animals turned off
into a side ravine and disappeared among trees and
brush and were seen no longer. Then the boys went
back to their horses, remounted and rode on up the
trail.</p>

<p>After a time they came up out of the ravine into a
narrow grassy valley with little groves of quaking
aspen and bordered on either side by high ridges of
weathered pink granite. Here the slope was gradual,
until at the head of the valley they reached a rolling
plateau, with aspens here and there, and farther off
higher hills, crowned by pines. The country they
were entering was singularly picturesque. Donald
was greatly impressed, while the apparently practical
Jack Mason declared that it was as pretty a hunting
country as he'd ever seen.</p>

<p>Everywhere in the bare soil of the plateau which
showed among the tufts of grass, already beginning
to turn yellow, were seen the traces of elk. Some
of the tracks had been made in the spring when the
soil was wet; they had sunk deep in the soft mud,
and showed the imprints of the dew-claws. Other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>much later foot-prints had been made on dry earth, but
were dull, windworn, and covered with dust; while occasionally
were seen tracks fresh and glistening, made
by animals which had passed along only a short time
before.</p>

<p>"There are certainly plenty of elk here," remarked
Jack Mason to the other Jack.</p>

<p>"Lots of them," was the reply. "Of course I
don't claim to know much about the whole West, but
I have never been in any place where elk seemed as
plentiful as they are here. We may ride on to some
at any time, and for the present we don't need to
hunt, because whenever we want to kill something
we can do it."</p>

<p>It was only a little later that Jack's prediction was
verified. As they rode across the opening of a little
valley they saw, less than two hundred yards away,
several cow elk and heifers feeding at the edge of
the brush near the timber.</p>

<p>"There," said Jack, "what did I tell you?"</p>

<p>"There they are," returned Jack Mason; "sure
enough."</p>

<p>Donald began to show some excitement.</p>

<p>"Shouldn't we go up there and try to kill them?"
he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"I think not," answered Jack. "We can get what
we need going home. I think it will be better fun
for us to ride on a little, and then climb up on some
high peak and sit there and look over the country."</p>

<p>"All right," said Donald, resignedly; "go ahead;
but I'd like to remind you of the story about the girl
who was sent into the woods to get a straight stick,
and kept rejecting pretty good sticks, hoping to get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>one still straighter, until finally, when she got to the
outside she had to take one that was crooked."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" laughed Mason. "That's the way I've
seen it done often with hunters. But let's follow
Jack, Donald. He's the boss, and if we don't get any
meat, we'll put the blame on him, and make lots of
fun of him when we get back to the ranch."</p>

<p>"Let it be so," acquiesced Donald.</p>

<p>Jack Danvers grinned.</p>

<p>"I'll accept it," he said.</p>

<p>For three quarters of an hour they rode on, constantly
ascending by a gentle slope. Two or three
times they saw other elk near or far off, and more than
once Jack was warned by Donald of the humiliation
of being laughed at when they got back to the ranch.
But Jack only laughed and intimated that Donald was
a British pilgrim.</p>

<p>At last Jack dismounted at a little grove of pine
timber, at the foot of a rocky hill, steep and broken.</p>

<p>"Let's stop here," he said, "and climb up to the
top of this hill and see what there is to look at.
When we get up there, Donald can soothe his feelings
with the British pipe he carries and the rest of
us will study the landscape."</p>

<p>The horses were tied, and a short scramble brought
the men to the sharp peak of the hill&mdash;a rocky needle
standing up several hundred feet above the plateau.
From this summit was had a wide view which really
justified Jack. To the south and east they looked
out over the basin where the ranch was, though the
distance was so great that there was no detail. Behind
them, to the north and west, was a stretch of
plateau broken by groves and lines of pines and aspens,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>and in the little parks among this timber were a number
of animals, most of them elk, though there were
some antelope. On the plateau between the basin
from which they had come and the pinnacle on which
they stood, in many little parks and openings were
elk and in one of the larger parks a herd of antelope.</p>

<p>"Why," exclaimed Jack Mason, "this is a regular
elk pasture! It seems to me the elk are thicker here
than the cattle on the prairie, where we passed along
only a few days ago."</p>

<p>"Well," replied Jack, "there are a great many elk
up here, and very few people come here to hunt them.
A few of the ranch people round about, when they
need fresh meat, come here and kill it, and that is
all the hunting that is done here. But I'm afraid
the place is getting talked about. I heard last year
of three or four settlers from down in Colorado who
came up to the Hole, where most of the elk winter,
and loaded up their wagons with their winter's meat.
If three or four people from Colorado did that last
year, it's likely that a dozen or twenty will do it
this year, and two or three times that number the
year after. If they do that, that will be the end of
the elk here; and I guess they'll do it."</p>

<p>The boys sat there for an hour or two looking over
this lovely mountain prospect, and then Jack Danvers
stood up.</p>

<p>"Well, I really hate to do it," he said, "but I suppose
we've got to go down and kill something, and
take it back to the ranch."</p>

<p>They climbed down the steep hill and untied their
horses.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>
<p>"Now," Jack cautioned the boys, "we ought to go
more carefully. Donald, I expect you'd like to kill
an elk, wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>"You bet I would!"</p>

<p>"All right then; let's go on and do it."</p>

<p>On the return they took a valley a little to the west
of the one they had followed up, and it was not very
long before Jack halted and called a council.</p>

<p>"Now it seems to me that just beyond this point
of timber we saw from the hill a little bunch of elk,
and among them there's likely to be the animal we
want&mdash;a fat yearling. I don't suppose there'll be
any trouble in getting up to it&mdash;not half as much
as there'd be in getting up to a range cow on foot&mdash;but
let's go on. We can ride until we see the elk,
and then get off to shoot."</p>

<p>They entered the green timber in single file, Jack
in the lead and Jack Mason bringing up the rear
with the pack animal. It was all very simple. Before
they reached the edge of the timber on the other
side, Jack, who had been looking carefully, stopped
and craned his neck to one side and then slipped off
his horse and beckoned to Donald.</p>

</div>



<p>Very quietly the two proceeded on foot, and before
they reached the edge of the timber Jack pointed
out to Donald two or three elk lying near the opening,
but he motioned to him to wait before shooting.
After a little study Jack fixed on a fat yearling
that lay slightly apart from the others, and told Donald
to shoot it behind the shoulder and low down.
When the shot rang out all the elk sprang to their
feet, except the one Donald had hit. This one partly
raised itself and then lay down again, and after a moment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>put its head on the ground. The other elk
stood about looking. The boys went back for their
horses, and when they came out from the timber toward
the dead animal, the other elk were hardly a
hundred yards away and were walking up the little
park without showing any alarm.</p>

<p>To prepare the elk's carcass for transportation to
camp and to load the greater part of it on the pack
horse took only a little time, and the boys went on
toward home.</p>

<p>Jack congratulated Donald on the shot.</p>

<p>"It was a good one," he said, "and I believe you're
an older hunter than I thought. The way you killed
that antelope the other day, and this elk, makes me
think that you've done a lot of hunting. Of course,
I'm not much of a believer in this buck-fever that
you read about in the books, but it certainly is true
that when pilgrims are shooting at game for the first
time, they don't always keep their heads. I reckon,
though, that you've hunted more than I supposed, and
I believe that you can shoot all right, and maybe can
beat some of us out here who think we can shoot
pretty steadily."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a><br /><br />

<small><small>FLAGGING AN ANTELOPE</small></small></h2>


<p>The days passed pleasantly and swiftly. It was not
the season for killing game, and except when fresh
meat was required no hunting was done. Nevertheless,
there was work enough. Every day one man
rode off and made a long round of the basin looking
carefully for the tracks of cattle leading away from
it. If fresh tracks were seen, the cattle were followed,
rounded up, and driven back to the home range.</p>

<p>The work on a ranch is never ended. The irrigating
ditches had to be looked after and the water from
time to time turned on or off the hay-fields or the
garden-patch. Haying time would come before long,
and in that country hay was money, and worth more
than a cent a pound. When no work was pressing,
Jack Danvers and Donald got on their horses and
rode down to the lake, and perhaps lay there on a
little knoll and with their glasses watched the young
ducks swimming on the lake, or the young plover,
sandpipers and curlews that fed along its borders.
The first two or three times the boys went down there,
all the young birds hid, and the old ones made a great
outcry, the curlews and plovers flying over them and
whistling shrilly as if to frighten them away; but after
a time the birds seemed to become accustomed to the
boys and to regard them as ordinary objects the
landscape and no longer to be feared.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>
<p>One of Donald's early visits to the lake resulted in
a situation that gave him some discomfort and uneasiness,
and cost him a pair of boots and spurs. He
saw a brood of young ducks in a little cove and, intending
to try to capture them, he ran into the water
at the cove's mouth to cut them off from going back
into the lake. Almost before he reached the edge
of the water he sank so deep in the soft, soapy mire
that he wished to get back to firm ground, but found
that he could not stir. Jack had not seen what Donald
was doing until he had almost reached the water,
and then he called to him to come back. He now
shouted to Donald to stand still. Then he ran back
thirty or forty yards to his horse and, mounting, rode
to the edge of the firm ground, and from there tossed
his rope over Donald's head. Donald fixed it about
his chest, close under the arms, and Jack shortened
the rope and tried with his own strength to pull Donald
out, but found that impossible. He was fast in
the mire and, while he did not sink, he could move
his legs not at all. Jack took a turn on the rope
about the saddle-horn and started the horse away
gradually. This pulled Donald over, but did not
move his legs. Jack rode back again and got Donald's
horse, and threw that rope also over Donald's
head; then, stripping off his own coat, he tossed it to
Donald and told him to wrap it around his chest and
so to make a pad against which the ropes could
draw.</p>

<p>Having thus put in operation the precise thing that
Hugh had done for him five or six years before, Jack
stood the two horses side by side and slowly led them
forward. The strain on Donald was severe. The pull
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>bowed him forward until his trunk was parallel with
the sloping beach and then suddenly, with a mighty
pluck, he was drawn from the mud and thrown heavily
on the ground. Jack stopped the horses, and in a
moment the ropes were loosened and Donald recovered
his breath. His legs were uninjured, and Jack asked
him how his chest felt.</p>

<p>"Whew! I feel as if a grizzly bear had been hugging
me, and hugging me tight! Honestly, I thought
I heard my ribs crack just before I was pulled out."</p>

<p>"Well, it's not very good fun. I had Hugh do
that precise thing to me once, when I was a little
fellow, and I thought I was going to pull to pieces."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that you ever did so foolish
a trick as to walk into a mud hole like that?"</p>

<p>Jack laughed.</p>

<p>"In my case it was quicksand, but the effect was
the same. My feet and legs from the knees downward
were gripped fast and I couldn't get out. I
really don't suppose I ever came as near dying as I
did that day. It was just the accident of Hugh's coming
into camp at the right moment, and seeing and
hearing me, that got me out of it. I think on that
trip I learned a couple of lessons about doing what
I was told to that I have never forgotten, and my instruction
came in the shape of two huge scares. Say,
you seem to have shed your foot-gear in that mud."</p>

<p>"Yes," Donald replied. "If they had not let go,
I would probably be there still, or at least a part of
me. You might have succeeded in pulling the upper
part of my body away, but my feet and legs would
have been down there yet."</p>

<p>"Well," said Jack, "there's no hope of recovering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>anything from that mud. You'll have to get new shoes
and spurs."</p>

<p>"Spurs I'll have to get, but I have shoes at the
ranch."</p>

<p>It was two or three weeks after their elk hunt that
the two boys, on being told that fresh meat was
again needed, decided that they would go over to
Willow Creek, twenty-five miles from home, where
the Pick ranch had an old cabin, and camping there
would try to kill three or four buck antelope. Donald
was especially keen about that, for though in previous
trips to the United States he had killed one or two
antelope his experience with this curious and interesting
animal was limited.</p>

<p>It was proposed that Jack Mason should go along.
Each man would take his saddle horse and while two
would ride, the third would drive the wagon, his
saddle animal carrying the saddle being tied up to
the hames of one of the team horses. In the wagon
they would take a tent and three or four days' grub.</p>

<p>They started one morning in good season and were
four or five miles from the ranch before the sun showed
its face over the high eastern hills.</p>

<p>A little farther on, as Jack and Donald rode up
on a low ridge, Jack saw off to the left a yearling
buck antelope, distant not more than sixty or seventy
yards, which gazed steadily at them. Jack pulled up
and motioned to Donald to get off his horse and kill
the yearling, which, notwithstanding their movements,
stood looking at them. Donald gave Jack his reins
and stepped behind the horses, where he threw a
cartridge into his gun and fired at the antelope. At
the report the yearling trotted a few steps toward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>them, and Jack saw the ball strike the prairie far
beyond the animal. Again Donald fired, and again
the antelope advanced a few steps. Jack saw the
second bullet knock up the dust far toward the hillside.</p>

<p>"You're shooting too high!" he called to Donald;
"you're seeing too much of your foresight. Draw
down a good deal finer and aim at the point of his
breast."</p>

<p>The third time Donald shot; and this time the antelope
fell.</p>

<p>"Where did you hold for that last shot?" asked
Jack, as the two rode up to the fallen animal.</p>

<p>"Square for the breast," said Donald.</p>

<p>"Well, if that's the case, you must draw your
sight still finer, for I believe you hit that antelope in
the neck, high up."</p>

<p>When they dismounted this proved to be the fact.
The antelope's neck was broken by a ball which had
entered the throat only about three inches beneath
the head.</p>

<p>"Was this antelope insane?" Donald asked Jack,
as they began the work of dressing the animal.
"Why did he not run away? Instead of doing that
he kept coming closer at each shot."</p>

<p>"That's easily explained. In the first place, the sun
was shining square in his eyes, and we were between
him and the sun, therefore he could not make out
what we were. Besides that, you see he's a yearling,
and it's quite possible that he never before heard the
sound of a gun. Evidently it did not scare him at all."</p>

<p>"Well," said Donald, "I'm glad to have that explained.
If you had not told me how it was, I should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>certainly have believed that I had killed a patient
that had escaped from some antelope lunatic asylum."</p>

<p>"That conundrum was an easy one," laughed Jack.
"One trouble with most of us is that we look at things
from our own little view-point, and imagine that other
creatures look at things as we do. You ought to
talk to Hugh about that. He's thought more about
it than anybody I ever talked to, and he's given me
whatever ideas I may have."</p>

<p>By this time the antelope was dressed and the team
had driven up close to it. The carcass was loaded
in and they went on again. About eleven o'clock they
crossed a little stream which was the last water they
would find until they reached camp at night, and
they would have a long drive of twelve or fifteen miles
across a dry flat. Accordingly they stopped here, unsaddled
their horses and let them drink and feed, and
cooked themselves a cup of coffee. An hour later,
hitching up again, and with Jack in the wagon as driver,
they started on; and an hour or two before sundown
reached the willow-grown bottom where their camp
was to be pitched.</p>

<p>As Jack and Donald were unhitching the team
horses, Jack Mason, who had been riding off to one
side, galloped up and, dismounting and throwing down
his reins, jumped into the wagon and began rapidly to
throw out the beds, tent and tent-poles. Donald took
the team horses down to water, and the grub box and
meat were lifted out. In a moment they had picked
out a place for the tent and were soon putting in the
tent-poles.</p>

<p>"Before we unsaddle, Jack," Mason said, "you and
I had better ride off to take a look at some cattle that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>I see feeding on the prairie off to the north. If they
should happen to be Mr. Sturgis' cattle, we ought to
turn 'em back to the ranch. It seems to me I heard
Rube speak the other night of seeing some tracks leading
off in this direction, but somehow he lost the trail
and couldn't find 'em. It may be that these are the
cattle, and if there's any beef among 'em they certainly
ought to be thrown back now."</p>

<p>"Right you are," said Jack. "Let's get the tent
up and then we'll leave Donald to pack wood and water
and build the fire, and we'll go off and look at the
cattle."</p>

<p>Donald was ready to attend to the cooking so far as
he could. There really was not much to do, for they
had brought some bread; and all that was necessary
was to cut and fry some meat, and boil the coffee.
Jack suggested that Donald might skin the antelope
and get the meat ready for frying. It would take the
two Jacks only a short time to ride over to the cattle,
but if they proved to be Sturgis' cattle they ought to
be looked after. If they had located themselves up
on the high bench and were likely to stay there, there
was no special reason for driving them back into the
Basin; on the other hand, if they were slowly traveling
away from the Basin they ought to be turned back.</p>

<p>When the boys reached the cattle&mdash;only fifteen or
eighteen head&mdash;they found that they were Sturgis'
cattle, chiefly cows and young stock, but with them
four or five steers, some of which would be ready for
shipment that autumn. A careful look over the
ground, and the discovery of a more or less worn trail
where the cattle seemed for several days to have been
going to water, made the men think that the animals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>were not traveling, but would stay there, or thereabout,
for some time.</p>

<p>"Well," said Jack Danvers, "I believe these cattle
have stopped here. Why not leave them alone, and
keep an eye on them for the day or two that we are
hunting here, and then when we start back two of us
can drive them along to the ranch and turn them
loose down by the lake?"</p>

<p>"I guess that's the thing to do," agreed Jack Mason.
"Meantime, if they should move away, one of us can
pick up the trail and probably overtake 'em. I don't
seem to remember any of these cows on the round-up,
but of course they were there."</p>

<p>"I remember that black and white cow and her calf,
and that bob-tailed bay steer over there. I think the
day they were cut out was about the time you went
into town to interview your friend Claib Wood."</p>

<p>Mason laughed.</p>

<p>"I just envy you fellows the fun you had out of
that little argument that Claib and I had in town. I
believe I've been better than a comic paper to that
round-up camp, and it didn't cost 'em anything, either."</p>

<p>When they returned to camp they found that Donald
had been busy. The beds were in the tent ready for
unrolling; the antelope had been skinned and meat cut
for frying; the coffee had been boiled and was standing
in the ashes near the fire where it would keep hot.
Donald had unsaddled his horse and turned it loose
with drag-rope, and had tied the ropes of the two
work horses to bunches of sage-brush.</p>

<p>"Bully for you!" called Jack. "This looks like
business. Just as soon as we picket our horses we can
have supper."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>
<p>The work of picketing the horses so that they could
get as much grass as possible and yet would not get
tangled in one another's ropes was soon over, and
before the sun had set the simple meal was finished and
the dishes washed, ready for breakfast.</p>

<p>The night was clear and warm, with a full moon,
and nothing disturbed the rest of the hunters, though
as they fell asleep they heard the chorus of coyotes
from the nearby hills.</p>

<p>It was not light the next morning when Jack Danvers
heard Mason putting on his shoes, and a moment later
pushing aside the flap of the tent. Jack also began to
dress and in a very few minutes the two men were preparing
breakfast around the dancing fire. Dawn had
come and was swiftly spreading over the sky. Jack
called to Donald, who groaned a response but before
long appeared at the fire just in time to be saluted by
Jack, who had returned from the stream with the
bucket and the coffee-kettle filled with water.</p>

<p>After breakfast, the three rode a little way to the
north, where from a high knoll they could see the cattle,
placed just about as they had been the night before;
and then, turning east and passing through some broken
country, they came to a rolling plateau more or less
interrupted by ravines, where they saw not a few antelope.
Most of these were busily feeding on the higher
ground and for a time the boys could see no way of
approaching any of them. Finally Donald and Jack
Danvers, leaving their horses, set out to crawl up a
low swale which they hoped might bring them within
long shot of a herd of eight or ten antelope guarded
apparently by a big buck. They crawled and crawled
under the hot sun, and Donald thought that he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>never been in any place where it was so hot as this.
Moreover, flies&mdash;small but very hungry&mdash;buzzed
about his head, and stung his neck and ears, and he
seriously wondered whether the antelope they were
after were worth all this effort.</p>

<p>They were still a long way from the game when the
little water-course in which they were crawling spread
out and became so shallow that it was impossible to
proceed farther without being seen.</p>

<p>"This seems to be our finish," Jack said, "unless
you feel like shooting at them at this distance; and if
I were you, I wouldn't do it. There's a possibility of
hitting, but no more than that; and if you miss, when
these antelope run, everything that sees them will be on
the lookout and ready to run."</p>

<p>"It isn't likely that I could hit at this distance," answered
Donald. "I wish that they would come up
nearer."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid wishing won't do you much good,"
laughed Jack.</p>

<p>"Say, I used to read about flagging antelope. Have
you ever tried it?"</p>

<p>"No; I never have. I guess likely they used to do
it in old times, but I fancy in these days the antelope
are too smart to be fooled by anything like that. To
be sure, I've seen antelope come back to look a second
time, or a third time, at something that they had seen
but couldn't make out; but I'm afraid the flagging
business won't work."</p>

<p>"Well," suggested Donald, "why not try it anyhow?
If we don't show ourselves it isn't likely to scare them;
and it's possible that they may notice it."</p>

<p>"How are you going to work it?" Jack asked.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>
<p>"This red handkerchief around my neck will do
for a flag. But there's nothing to tie it to except our
two guns, and if it succeeds we ought to use them for
another purpose."</p>

<p>"Why, here," said Jack, "I'll take this rod from
my rifle and we can tie the flag to that."</p>

<p>Jack's rifle was fitted with tubes below the barrel and
through these ran the slender steel rod which might
be used to drive out a shell, if by any chance one should
stick in the breech of the gun.</p>

<p>Jack took the rod from its place and tied Donald's
handkerchief to one end and then slowly raised it in
the air and waved it in plain sight of the antelope. For
a short time they did not notice it, and then an old doe
faced around toward the boys and stood there looking;
and in a moment all of them were looking. Presently
the old doe started off on a canter to get nearer to the
flag. She galloped for forty or fifty yards, then
stopped and looked. Then she turned and trotted off a
short distance, and turned and looked again; and then
galloped up still nearer. And what this old doe did all
the others did. Presently it seemed as if the buck took
courage&mdash;as if perhaps he wanted to show off before
his family. He galloped up to within seventy-five or
eighty yards, and then, turning to the left, made as if
he would circle around this strange thing that fluttered
to the wind.</p>

<p>"Now!" whispered Jack. "He may not come any
nearer. If you can, hit him when he is trotting; or,
if you'll wait for him to stop, I believe you can get him.
I think I would wait; he'll probably stop before he
has gone far."</p>

<p>So it turned out. Before long the buck stopped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>and faced squarely around, and Donald, with the
memory of the previous night's shooting in his mind,
drew a very fine sight on the antelope's chest, low
down, and fired. The buck reared on his hind legs
and, holding his fore legs stiffly out before him, fell
over backward. The does looked at him for a moment
and then scurried off like so many frightened rabbits,
while the boys, rising from the ground, stretched their
cramped limbs and stamped about to restore the circulation.</p>

<p>"That was another good shot, Donald. I'd like to
know how you held, and we'll see just where the ball
hit."</p>

<p>"I drew the sight just as fine as I possibly could,
and held on the very lower edge of his breast. If the
ball flew as high as last night it seems to me it ought to
have broken the lower part of his neck, but if I held
right, and the life line is as low as I fancy you say it
is, I believe that I must have hit his heart."</p>

<p>When they reached the buck, they found that Donald
had done just that. The ball had entered an inch and
a half or two inches above the lower level of the breast,
and a little to one side of the breast-bone; had pierced
the heart and gone entirely through the antelope.</p>

<p>Jack shook hands with Donald.</p>

<p>"A good shot!" he exclaimed. "I shouldn't be
surprised if you could beat us all with the rifle."</p>

<p>The shot had so thoroughly bled the antelope that
it was unnecessary to cut its throat, and when it was
ripped up all the blood in its body seemed to have
gathered in the visceral cavity.</p>

<p>Before the antelope was dressed Jack Mason came up
with their horses.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>
<p>"My!" he exclaimed, bending over and resting on
the saddle-horn as he watched the boys at work, "that's
a fine head. You don't often see one like that. Why
don't you take it, Donald, and carry it back to the old
country to ornament the walls of your baronial hall?"</p>

<p>"I believe I will, Mason," said Donald; "and when
I get it hung on those walls, I'll invite you and Claib
Wood to come over and give us your little barroom
act. We can have lots of Western color in the village
where I live, with just a few of the properties."</p>

<p>Mason laughed.</p>

<p>"I believe it would have been better if I'd killed
Claib," he said. "You fellow's wouldn't have so much
to josh about then."</p>

<p>The two following days spent at this camp resulted
in the capture of three more buck antelope, and the
next morning camp was broken and the wagon started
back to the basin. Donald drove, while Jack Mason and
Jack Danvers rode well out on the prairie and rounded
up all the cattle they could see and drove them slowly
toward the ranch. In the early part of the day the
cattle were slow to move, but after the sun got hotter
and more directly overhead they seemed to work along
better, and shortly after noon had the appearance of
really striking out after water, which, of course, in due
time they found.</p>

<p>At the place where the road crossed the water Donald
had stopped, unhitched his team, taken off the
bridles and tied the animals out to feed; and Mason
and Jack were delighted when they came in sight of
the camp to see Donald fussing about the fire and to
find a good meal just about ready.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>
<p>A few hours later the cattle were turned loose just
outside the big pasture beyond the lake, and the little
hunting party rode up to the ranch, its mission accomplished.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a><br /><br />

<small><small>THE DANCE AT THE SCHOOLHOUSE</small></small></h2>


<p>The weeks went by. Haying time came and all
hands were busy cutting, hauling and stacking. The
winter had been one of heavy snows, and water was
plentiful in the irrigating ditches. Rains had been
more frequent than usual that spring and summer, and
in many a little meadow, too small for fencing, there
was a growth of grass worth cutting. One of the
labors of the summer about which the men growled
bitterly was the never-ending work of keeping the
range cattle away from these little unfenced pieces, in
order to protect the growing grass. The cattle returned
again and again to these patches of fresh green
grass, and the men were forced to exercise constant
vigilance to keep them off the meadows.</p>

<p>At last the haying was over. The stacks were all
protected from the wind and carefully fenced against
ravages of the range stock. Now the nights were
growing shorter and cooler; sometimes there was a
frost, with a skim of ice. The leaves of the aspens
began to turn yellow. Down on the lake the broods
of young ducks which had been reared there were
gradually being added to by the arrivals of early migrants
from the north. The last time Jack and Donald
went out on the mountains for fresh meat for the
house, they had killed a bull elk whose horns, though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>still wearing the velvet, were full-grown and hard, and
the animal was fat. September was at hand, and before
many days Jack would be obliged to turn his face
eastward and get back to college and work.</p>

<p>"Well, boys," Mr. Sturgis said one morning at
breakfast, "it's about time for us to gather our beef
and start it in to the railroad. We ought to find it all
pretty close at home, and I hope we can begin to-morrow,
and gather it and take it to the railroad in
short order."</p>

<p>The day was devoted to getting up the horses and
preparing the wagon for the short trip, for early the
next morning they were to start for a little stream
twelve or fifteen miles away, where there was a corral
and a good camping place. Hugh had declared that on
this trip he would drive the team and would cook, and
Jack, Donald, Jack Mason, Rube and Mr. Sturgis were
to gather the beef.</p>

<p>Donald, who had become reasonably skilful with the
rope and at home on a cow horse, declared that if Hugh
could cook he could wrangle the horses, and that he
would do that in addition to his riding. It was not
likely that there would be any night herding to be done.
The beeves, as they were cut out in considerable
bunches, could be sent back to the ranch and held in
the pasture for a short time; while the horse bunch
would be likely to stay with the old bell mare that most
of them knew so well.</p>

<p>Long before sunrise, the riders set out, traveling to
the northeast, intending to ride circle of the basin and
to turn in toward the camp all the cattle found. These
could be turned loose again after the beef had been cut
out; and possibly there would be time for another circle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>to the south, when more cattle could be brought in the
same night or the next morning; when again the beef
would be cut out, and the cows and young stock turned
loose.</p>

<p>Not long after the riders had gone, Hugh climbed
into the wagon and, chirruping to his team, soon disappeared
down the valley.</p>

<p>It was a fine morning for riding, and all the men felt
its invigorating influence. The air was keen but dry,
a light breeze just stirred the tops of the sage and the
taller grass stems, and from the bushes everywhere
sounded the sweet, melancholy, autumn whistle of the
meadow-lark.</p>

<p>Few cattle were found as the riders went north, but
as soon as they turned east and south they came on
frequent groups, brought in not long before from the
round-up. The cattle were fat and logy, and the work
of pushing them along was slow, so that not nearly
so much ground was covered, nor so much accomplished
as had been hoped. Nevertheless, it was a respectable
bunch of cattle that was driven up that afternoon near
the wagon, where the work of cutting began.</p>

<p>Some years before, Mr. Sturgis had built near this
place a large and stout corral of poles hauled from the
mountains, and it was in this that the beeves were to
be put and held, until enough had been brought together
to drive up to the ranch.</p>

<p>The work of cutting went on rapidly, and before
night all the steers fit to ship had been put in the corral.
Then two of the men set out and drove the cows and
the young stock up toward the mountains, throwing
them back as far as possible on to the ground from
which they had been brought that morning. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>would leave the country to be ridden the next day free
from cattle until they started to make their circle and
would meet an entirely new lot. The steers were to be
held in the corral until morning, when two of the men
would take them back to the ranch and throw them into
the pasture. While that was being done&mdash;for the
next twenty-four hours&mdash;there would be only three
men to ride and cut, instead of five, but Hugh said that
he would help.</p>

<p>Long before daylight the next morning, Rube and
Donald set out for the ranch with the steers. The
animals were hungry and thirsty. At first the work of
driving them was slow, but as the sun rose and the heat
increased the steers traveled faster, for most of them,
knowing the range, knew also that water was to be
found six or eight miles ahead, and they were anxious
for water. After they had drunk, driving was again
slow; but in the afternoon they reached the ranch,
where with Joe's help the cattle were put in the big
pasture. After a bite to eat, the men started back to
the wagon, and reached it some time after dark.</p>

<p>Here they found that, notwithstanding the shortness
of riders, another good gather of cattle had been made,
and again there was a corral full of beef. These Mr.
Sturgis declared might as well wait there for a day,
when it was hoped that the rest of the country would
be covered, the beef cut out, and the whole herd taken
to the ranch, to be sent to the railroad a few days later
for shipment.</p>

<p>So it turned out. By evening the whole Basin had
been rounded up, all the beef it was desired to ship
turned into the corral, and the round-up outfit was
ready to start back. On the gather there had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>little that was exciting, but an abundance of hard work,
although there had been no riding night herd, for which
the boys were devoutly thankful.</p>

<p>The return to the ranch was deliberate, and it took
them two days to get there. The beeves were driven a
short distance in the early morning and allowed to
feed and rest, and then another short drive in the afternoon
completed the day's travel; but the steers were
herded at night, and because of the small number of
men the tours of duty were long&mdash;instead of three
reliefs there was only one. However, this was for a
single night only.</p>

<p>For two weeks the beef was left in the pasture and
in this time regained whatever weight it had lost in the
round-up. The men who from time to time rode into
the pasture and around among the cattle were proud
of their quality&mdash;it was certainly a bunch to bring joy
to its owner.</p>

<p>At length Mr. Sturgis received word that in three
days the cars for his shipment would be on the railroad
siding, and the beef was started to town. The journey
was unmarked by any special incident; but the herd
had not been long on the road before it was learned
that another bunch of beef was also on the way to the
railroad and would reach there about the same time
as Mr. Sturgis' cattle. This was important news, for
it was not certain that the loading corrals were large
enough to hold many more cattle than those in Mr.
Sturgis' gather, and if the other people should by any
chance get first to the railroad and occupy the corrals,
the matter might be a serious one, as there was no feed
for the cattle within six or eight miles of the town.</p>

<p>That night Mr. Sturgis asked Jack to ride over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>next morning to where the other cattle were being
driven, and find out definitely whose they were, how
many, and when they expected to ship. Meantime the
Sturgis beeves would be driven on to the railroad; but
if there should be any likelihood that for any cause the
shipment would be delayed, the cattle would be turned
off the road before the town was reached, and held
until it was possible to see what should be done.</p>

<p>It was late that night when Jack returned to the
camp, and as soon as he had turned out his horse he
went to his uncle.</p>

<p>"It was a false alarm," he reported; "the cattle that
are coming are Mr. Powell's, and there are only about
one hundred of them. He has ordered cars and hopes
to ship with you. He and Charley were proposing to
go on to Chicago with the cattle, and to help with ours
as well as theirs. That will make four or five men to
the train."</p>

<p>"We shall certainly be glad to have the help of those
extra men," said Mr. Sturgis. "I've been wondering
what we were going to do. There ought to be at least
four men with these cattle; and six would be better. I
may have to get Rube and Mason and Hugh to go; but
Hugh is getting a little bit old for work of that kind."</p>

<p>"I'd like to go," said Jack, "but I must get back, I
suppose. I've lost too much time, as it is. I can help
load, but then I must take the passenger. Another
thing; I hear there is going to be a dance in town two
nights from now. Charley Powell brought the news
when he came out the other day, and Mrs. Powell and
Bess are with the Powell outfit, going to the dance."</p>

<p>"I suppose likely the whole country will be there.
What do you know about the Claib Wood and Mason
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>trouble, Jack? Is that likely to be renewed when we
get into town? I don't think Mason is likely to make
any trouble; but Wood has rather a bad name. Suppose
you speak to Mason about it before we get in, and
I'll try to find Wood there and we'll see if we can't stop,
or at least postpone, any renewal of this quarrel."</p>

<p>Two days later the beeves were in the loading corrals,
but the promised cars had not yet made their appearance.
Mr. Sturgis, knowing of old the uncertainties of
railroad promises, had provided against such a contingency
by arranging for a lot of hay, and the beeves
were fed that night and were to be fed again the next
morning. It was hoped that during the night the cars
would come. Powell's cattle came in a little later than
the Sturgis herd, and they also had to be fed, and fed
with Mr. Sturgis' hay. The next day, if it were not
possible to load, it would be necessary to drive the
beeves eight or ten miles over to the banks of the Medicine
Bow River and to hold them there.</p>

<p>Before they reached town, Jack spoke to Mason
about the possibility of further trouble with Claib
Wood, and Mason declared that, so far as he was concerned,
he had got through with Wood, and had absolutely
nothing against him.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Mason, "I'll be on the lookout,
and if Claib tries any of his tricks on me, I'll have to
be just a little bit quicker than he is; but I've no quarrel
with Claib, and don't want any."</p>

<p>Soon after they reached town Mr. Sturgis looked up
Claib, and had quite a talk with him. He was apparently
fully recovered from his injuries, but the
weeks that he had spent under a roof had bleached
away his outdoor color and he looked pale and thin.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>
<p>"I tell you, Mr. Sturgis," said Claib, "I've no very
good feelings toward Jack Mason, for he picked a
quarrel with me, and hurt me just for meanness."</p>

<p>"In one way, I suppose that's true," answered Mr.
Sturgis; "but, on the other hand, it's only fair for you
to remember that you shot Rufe Mason without any
particular provocation or quarrel, and it's natural that
Jack should remember what you had done to his
brother."</p>

<p>"Well," admitted Claib, "that's so. I never ought
to have shot Rufe, and I wouldn't have done it, only I
was drunk and quarrelsome. I expect it was natural
for Jack Mason to want to get even with me. I've had
time during the last two months to do a whole lot of
thinking, and I'll say this, that if Jack Mason is willing
to wipe it out, I'll say the same and shake hands with
him on it."</p>

<p>"I'm mighty glad to hear you say that, Claib," said
Mr. Sturgis; "and I'll be glad to see you two shake
hands. You're both good men, and I'd be sorry to see
either killed. I feel sure that Mason is willing to call
it square, if you will. The next time you see Mason,
go up to him, man fashion, and tell him how you feel.
I'm sure you'll find him ready to make peace."</p>

<p>Early that day people from the neighboring ranches&mdash;men,
women and children&mdash;began to gather for the
coming dance, and the town showed unusual excitement.
Women, young girls and children passed along
the streets, going from one store to another, tasting the
delights of the shopping tours that came to them so infrequently.
In more than one of the saloons were heard
sounds of the fiddles to be played by the musicians for
the dance; but the master of ceremonies, dreading lest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>these musicians should become too tipsy during the day
to furnish the music in the evening, had appointed a
trustworthy person to go about with each one and see
that he did not drink.</p>

<p>Soon after dark, wagons began to drive up to the
schoolhouse and to unload their freight of laughing,
chattering people, excited by the prospect of the dance;
and a little later the frequent pounding of quick galloping
hoofs told that the cowboys were gathering. Before
long the rail to which the horses were tied was
crowded from end to end, while their riders gathered
on either side of the door, squatted on the ground and
smoked their pipes and cigarettes and discussed the
events of the range&mdash;the calf crop, the incidents of
the round-ups, and the piece of beef.</p>

<p>Presently from within the building came the sound of
music, and a number of the men rose to their feet, threw
away their cigarettes and, with rasping shaps and clinking
spurs, entered the door. In the little anteroom,
each man paused to divest himself of spurs, shaps, belt
and six-shooter&mdash;all these things being tied together
and placed in a corner of the room.</p>

<p>In the ballroom the women and children sat on one
side and the men, rather shamefacedly, tiptoed over to
the other side and seated themselves. The costumes
were those of everyday wear, though most of the men
were freshly shaven. Some of them wore coats and
most of them overalls, often turned up for eight or ten
inches, so as to show the trousers beneath. Almost all
of them wore the high-heeled cowboy boots of the
period, and not one carried a weapon. The women
and children were dressed in their best; some of the
younger girls wore white, perhaps with a bright ribbon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>tied about the neck. Eyes shone bright and faces were
expectant.</p>

<p>The schoolhouse benches had been moved back close
to the wall and the extra ones put out through the
windows and piled up outside the building. At the end
of the room, on a little platform where commonly the
teacher sat, were the musicians. Four oil lamps on
the four sides of the room gave abundant light.</p>

<p>Presently Jim Decker, master of ceremonies, walked
over the floor holding a candle in one hand and a jack-knife
in the other, shaving wax on the floor, and then
trying with his foot to rub it into the wood; and at
length, when his candle was exhausted and he put his
knife in his pocket, a burst of music sounded from the
two fiddlers and the clarionet man.</p>

<p>"Take your partners for the quadrille!" Decker
shouted in stentorian tones.</p>

<p>A number of men at once crossed over, each bowing
low or nodding before the lady of his choice, and asking
her to dance; and in a few minutes the room was
crowded with promenading couples.</p>

<p>It was only a moment before this that Jack and Donald,
having come up from the corral where they had
been feeding and watering the stock, had entered the
room. Jack had told Donald about Bess Powell, and
wanted him to dance with her, but they were too late
for the first dance. As they lingered by the door, looking
for Mrs. Powell, to whom Donald must be presented,
the sets were formed and the dance began. Jim
Decker was calling off the figures in a rude rhyme.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Adams all, swing your Eves,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>was soon followed by the direction,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Balance to your limberger cheese."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Donald nudged Jack.</p>

<p>"Great, isn't it?" he whispered.</p>

<p>Jack assented by making the Indian sign for "chief,"
raising the upturned forefinger high above the head
and turning it downward.</p>

<p>A few moments later they were speaking with Mrs.
Powell.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you get here earlier, so that you could
have danced the first quadrille with Bess?" she said to
Jack. "She hoped you would ask her."</p>

<p>"Why, Mrs. Powell," he explained, "we were down
at the corral feeding and watering and only just got
here. Mr. Donald and I both want some dances with
Bess."</p>

<p>"She'll be glad to dance," was the response; "but
you'll have to wait a while."</p>

<p>The dancers were enjoying themselves greatly.
Though the men largely outnumbered the women, there
were at first some girls without partners. The novelty
of the surroundings struck terror to the hearts of some
of the most daring riders and ropers, and kept them
glued to their seats. Buck Wilson, Twenty-One Johnson,
and Red Casey of the Bar Lazy A, whose feats in
broncho busting and roping had made them famous on
the range, felt their courage ooze away when it came
to facing a girl and asking her to dance. Their bashfulness
was added to by the shouts of Jim Decker and
other older men, who tried to induce them to pluck up
heart and choose partners for the dance.</p>

<p>One by one timid men, who had not yet dared to
come into the ballroom, slipped through the door and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>apparently trying to make themselves as small as possible,
sidled over to seats on the men's side, and sat
down to look on.</p>

<p>Most of those who danced did so with real feeling
and great spirit. One or two men were extremely expert
in cutting pigeonwings, and jumping high in the
air; and some of them stamped in time to the music, so
that the air was full of dust. Most of the men, however,
were extremely quiet. At the end of each dance,
the men took the girls to their seats and, leaving them,
either retired to their side of the room or slipped out
of the door to smoke a cigarette or talk with those who
had not yet dared to venture into the room.</p>

<p>About midnight came supper&mdash;pies, cakes and
lemonade. Before this, Jack had had two dances with
Bess and Donald three, and Jack had also succeeded in
persuading Mrs. Powell to walk with him through a
quadrille.</p>

<p>It was at the dance that Jack Mason and Claib met.
Claib had come in while Mason was dancing, and had
seated himself to look on. As soon as Mason left his
partner, he walked directly over to Claib.</p>

<p>"Well, Claib, how goes it?" he asked cheerily.</p>

<p>"All right now, Jack; and I'd like to shake hands
with you, and call bygones bygones."</p>

<p>"That'll suit me to death, Claib," said Mason, giving
his former enemy a hearty handshake.</p>

<p>A little later, Mr. Sturgis appeared in the ballroom.
He shook hands with Mrs. Powell and Bess and then
looked about for the faces of his own outfit. When he
saw Mason, he told him that the cars had arrived, and
that he wanted all hands down to begin to load by daylight,
and asked him to tell the others.</p>

<p>Daylight had come before the dance ended, but when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>it broke up the Sturgis outfit were down in the loading
corrals, hard at work getting the steers into the cars as
fast as they could.</p>

<p>And the next morning Jack's heart-strings were
stretched when he shook hands with his friends and
took the passenger for the Atlantic coast.</p>
